This course also satisfies the training grant requirements of the NIH for education in the responsible conduct of research.</p>\n<p>Beginning in Spring 2004, this course will be titled "Survival Skills for Researchers: The Responsible Conduct of Research."</p>'}}},{node:{id:"d04640aa-1105-5caf-800d-8f2ad893bbde",title:"Engineering, Economics and Regulation of the Electric Power Sector",fromSemester:"Spring",fromYear:"2010",trackingTitle:"IDS.505J - Engineering, Economics and Regulation of the Electric Power Sector",imageSrc:"https://open-learning-course-data-rc.s3.amazonaws.com/ids-505j-engineering-economics-and-regulation-of-the-electric-power-sector-spring-2010/c7a7c58a4c930f5ab008559fb1fa4002_ids-505j10.jpg",description:{description:"<p>The course presents an in-depth interdisciplinary perspective of electric power systems, with regulation providing the link among the engineering, economic, legal and environmental viewpoints.
