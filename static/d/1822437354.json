It is designed to give students the knowledge and practical experience they need to interpret lab and field data. Basic probability concepts are introduced at the outset because they provide a systematic way to describe uncertainty. They form the basis for the analysis of quantitative data in science and engineering. The MATLAB&reg; programming language is used to perform virtual experiments and to analyze real-world data sets, many downloaded from the web. Programming applications include display and assessment of data sets, investigation of hypotheses, and identification of possible casual relationships between variables. This is the first semester that two courses, Computing and Data Analysis for Environmental Applications (1.017) and Uncertainty in Engineering (1.010),&nbsp;are being&nbsp;jointly offered&nbsp;and taught as a single course.</p>"},"url":"/courses/civil-and-environmental-engineering/1-017-computing-and-data-analysis-for-environmental-applications-fall-2003","shortUrl":"1-017-computing-and-data-analysis-for-environmental-applications-fall-2003","courseLevel":"Undergraduate","departmentNumber":"1","instructors":[{"directoryTitle":"Professor","firstName":"Dennis","lastName":"McLaughlin"}],"tags":[{"name":"probability"},{"name":"statistics"},{"name":"events"},{"name":"random variables"},{"name":"univariate distributions"},{"name":"multivariate distributions"},{"name":"uncertainty propagation"},{"name":"Bernoulli trials"},{"name":"Poisson processed"},{"name":"conditional probability"},{"name":"Bayes rule"},{"name":"random sampling"},{"name":"point estimation"},{"name":"interval estimation"},{"name":"hypothesis testing"},{"name":"analysis of variance"},{"name":"linear regression"},{"name":"computational analysis"},{"name":"data analysis"},{"name":"environmental engineering"},{"name":"applications"},{"name":"MATLAB"},{"name":"numerical modeling"},{"name":"probabilistic concepts"},{"name":"statistical methods"},{"name":"statistics"},{"name":"field data"},{"name":"laboratory data"},{"name":"numerical techniques"},{"name":"Monte Carlo simulation"},{"name":"variability"},{"name":"sampling"},{"name":"data sets"},{"name":"computer"},{"name":"uncertainty"},{"name":"interpretation"},{"name":"quantitative data"},{"name":"1.017"},{"name":"1.010"}],"toSemester":"-1","fromSemester":"Fall","toYear":"-1","fromYear":"2003","sortAs":"1.017","language":"en-US","coursePages":[{"id":"548f4c92-49e6-5178-84db-051b00beb3c7","trackingTitle":"1.017 - Syllabus","title":"Syllabus","url":"/courses/civil-and-environmental-engineering/1-017-computing-and-data-analysis-for-environmental-applications-fall-2003/syllabus","shortUrl":"syllabus","coursePageType":"CourseSection","text":{"text":"\n<h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Meeting Times</h2>\n<p>Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session</p>\n<h2 class=\"subhead\">Lecturer</h2>\n<p>Prof. Dennis Mc Laughlin</p>\n<h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>18.01, 18.02</p>\n<h2 class=\"subhead\">Description</h2>\n<p>Class periods will generally be divided into 40 minutes of lecture and 40 minutes of related hands-on computer work using laptops available in the classroom.&#160;In the beginning of the semester recitations will provide computer programming background for students without previous programming experience.&#160;Later, these recitations will be used for more in-depth virtual experiments and data analysis exercises and for discussion of homework problems.</p>\n<h2 class=\"subhead\">Assignments</h2>\n<p>The class includes several homework sets and three quizzes held during the two hour recitation periods.

PC</h3>\n<p>MATLAB&reg; may be started from a shortcut or from the WINDOWS Start button. This will bring up the MATLAB&reg; command/desktop window with the MATLAB&reg; prompt &gt;&gt;.</p>\n<p>You can specify the path name that MATLAB&reg; uses to search for program or data files in the <strong>current directory</strong> text box near the top of the command window. You can also save a set of path names that are routinely searched by selecting the <strong>Set Path...</strong> and then <strong>Add Folder ...</strong> from the <strong>File</strong> pulldown menu. </p>\n<h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Entering MATLAB&reg; commands</h3>\n<p>Interactive mode  &mdash; </p><p>Run individual MATLAB&reg; commands directly from the command window.</p>\n<p>Batch mode &mdash; Run a series of commands (a program) all at once. These commands are stored in a text file identified with a .m suffix.</p>\n<p>To create or modify program files for batch mode use the MATLAB&reg; editor. To start the MATLAB&reg; editor window from the main MATLAB&reg; window select <strong>New</strong> and then <strong>M-file</strong> from the <strong>File</strong> pulldown menu in the desktop window or enter the command <strong>edit</strong> from the command line. To edit an existing file select <strong>open</strong> and select the approriate file or enter <strong>edit</strong> followed by the file name.</p>\n<p>A batch mode MATLAB&reg; program can take the form of a script or a function:</p>\n<p>A script runs much as if you were typing the program statements in the command window. In particular, the values of all variables are retained in memory and are accessible even after the program has run. </p>\n<p>A function is similar, except that only designated variables are available outside the function.</p>\n<p>You can run a script or function by typing the name of its file (without the .m suffix) in the MATLAB&reg; command window. For example, if your program is stored in the file myprogram.m then you run it by entering: </p>\n<p> &gt;&gt; myprogram</p>\n<p>Depending on the display options you chose the results of the computations will be shown in the main MATLAB&reg; window, plotted in a separate plot window, or written to another file.</p>\n<h2 class=\"subhead\">MATLAB&reg; Resources</h2>\n<p>The MATLAB&reg; resources available to you both on-line and as hard copy are plentiful and easily accessible. The following links represent a brief summary of available MATLAB&reg; documentation to get you started.\n<h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Help within MATLAB&reg;</h3>\n</p><p>Typing <strong>helpdesk</strong> at the MATLAB&reg; prompt will bring up the MATLAB&reg; Helpdesk . This is a web page based version of the MATLAB&reg; documentation/manuals.</p>\n<p>Typing <strong>help [command]</strong> at the MATLAB&reg; prompt will give you a brief explanation of [command].</p>\n<p>If you DON'T know what command you are confused about, typing <strong>help</strong> at the MATLAB&reg; prompt will give you a list of categories. Then typing <strong>help [category]</strong> will produce a list of commands in [category]. For example, one of the categories is graphics. Typing <strong>help graphics</strong> produces a list of the MATLAB&reg; graphics commands.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/olh/Matlab/Matlab.html\">MATLAB&reg; on Athena</a>: A web-document covering basic MATLAB&reg; usage from Athena On-Line Help.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mit.edu/afs/sipb/project/www/matlab/imatlab/imatlab.html\">Inessential MATLAB&reg;</a>: SIPB document of basic MATLAB&reg; usage.?\n</p><p><a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/matlab/www/home.html\">MATLAB&reg; at MIT Homepage</a>: Information about MATLAB&reg; from the Athena people.

An important aspect of achieving these standards is to be sure that students are aware of expectations of faculty regarding academic honesty. This statement clarifies the faculty's expectations in 1.206J.   </p>\n<h2 class=\"subhead\">Assignments</h2>\n<p>Assignments performed by students for submission have a dual purpose. They are intended as educational devices, including the teaching of skills such as working in teams. They are also evaluation tools for the faculty in judging the quality of performance of individual students. Our policies are intended to balance these two purposes and, unless otherwise stated, these policies apply to all assignments.   </p>\n<p>Students <strong>currently</strong> taking this class can work together to conceptualize general approaches to assignments. However, unless otherwise specified for a particular assignment, the work you submit should be done completely on your own. This includes text, numerical calculations, mathematical derivations, diagrams, graphs, computer programs and output.   </p>\n<p><strong>Reference any written source you use in your submission.</strong></p>\n<h2 class=\"subhead\">In-class Exams</h2>\n<p>All work on in-class exams should be performed only by you. Materials you can bring into the examination will be specified by the faculty for each exam.   </p>\n<p>If you have any questions about how these policies relate to a specific situation, you should speak to Professor Barnhart.   </p>\n<p>Source: Professor Sussman's academic honesty statement for 1.221J.</p>"}},{"id":"476ed860-c7fa-55a9-bcef-b9307c4415c2","trackingTitle":"1.206J -

In 2016, the textbook was developed into a series of 55 short videos,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-009-learn-differential-equations-up-close-with-gilbert-strang-and-cleve-moler-fall-2015/index.htm\">Learn Differential Equations: Up Close with Gilbert Strang and Cleve Moler</a>.</em></p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Goals</h2> <p>The goals for 18.06 are using matrices and also understanding them.</p> <p>Here are key computations and some of the ideas behind them:</p> <ol>     <li>Solving Ax = b for square systems by elimination (pivots, multipliers, back substitution, invertibility of A, factorization into A = LU)</li>     <li>Complete solution to Ax = b (column space containing b, rank of A, nullspace of A and special solutions to Ax = 0 from row reduced R)</li>     <li>Basis and dimension (bases for the four fundamental subspaces)</li>     <li>Least squares solutions (closest line by understanding projections)</li>     <li>Orthogonalization by Gram-Schmidt (factorization into A = QR)</li>     <li>Properties of determinants (leading to the cofactor formula and the sum over all n! permutations, applications to inv(A) and volume)</li>     <li>Eigenvalues and eigenvectors (diagonalizing A, computing powers A^k and matrix exponentials to solve difference and differential equations)</li>     <li>Symmetric matrices and positive definite matrices (real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors, tests for x'Ax &gt; 0, applications)</li>     <li>Linear transformations and change of basis (connected to the Singular Value Decomposition - orthonormal bases that diagonalize A)</li>     <li>Linear algebra in engineering (graphs and networks, Markov matrices, Fourier matrix, Fast Fourier Transform, linear programming)</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Homework</h2> <p>The homeworks are essential in learning linear algebra. They are not a test and you are encouraged to talk to other students about difficult problems-after you have found them difficult. Talking about linear algebra is healthy. But you must write your own solutions.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Exams</h2> <p>There will be three one-hour exams at class times and a final exam. The use of calculators or notes is not permitted during the exams.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table summary=\"See table caption for summary.\" class=\"tablewidth50\">     <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption>     <thead>         <tr>             <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th>             <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th>         </tr>     </thead>     <tbody>         <tr class=\"row\">             <td>Problem sets</td>             <td>15%</td>         </tr>         <tr class=\"alt-row\">             <td>Three one-hour exams</td>             <td>45%</td>         </tr>         <tr class=\"row\">             <td>Final exam</td>             <td>40%</td>         </tr>     </tbody> </table></div> <h2 class=\"subhead\">MATLAB&reg;</h2> <p>Some homework problems will require you to use MATLAB, an important tool for numerical linear algebra.

The homework policy is provided for your information.</p><p>All homework grading will be based mostly on effort. The reasons are several. First, effort is something over which you have full control, whereas numerical correctness is much harder to control. We therefore want to remove any anxiety based on thoughts such as &quot;Did I get the right numerical answer or not?&quot; Second, we hope that this will discourage you from copying the work of others. The effort-based grading scale is P / D / F, with the following meanings and numerical conversions:</p> <ul>     <li>P (worth 2 points) Good effort: Problem essentially completed.</li>     <li>D (worth 1 points) Minimal effort: Problem partially done.</li>     <li>F (worth 0 point) No effort: Problem set not done, or essentially not done.</li> </ul> <p>Each problem (or part of longer problems) in the homework assignment will be graded according to this scale. Your problem set score will be the sum of all the grades on the individual problems (or parts of problems) in that set. Note that we define 'Good Effort' as completing all sections of a problem and employing sound physical principles. Assignments that are incomplete or demonstrate an inadequate physical understanding will not receive a 'P'. Further, if we suspect your work has been plagiarized, we reserve the right to assign an 'F' (0 points) to the entire problem set.</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Quiz Policy</h2> <p>There are two quizzes, which will each be administered on campus and will last for two hours.</p> <p>A scientific calculator and writing instrument will be required. Crib sheets, other written matter or pre-programmed calculators will not be allowed. We will provide an equation sheet during the quiz, and it will be available for review prior to the quiz.</p> <p>Students are strongly encouraged to take the quizzes at the specified times. In case a student has a major conflict (e.g., medical emergency) the instructors will likely administer an oral make-up quiz.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Academic Honesty</h2> <p>You have joined a community of scholars at MIT. In joining that community, you have inherently assented to embracing the values of that community. Among those values is a commitment to honesty with yourself, your peers and your faculty. We believe that most of our students are academically honest; and as a consequence, the faculty will assume that the class is abiding by this covenant. If evidence comes to light that an individual or group of individuals are not, in addition to direct sanctions within the course structure, the case will be referred to the Committee on Discipline.</p> <p>You should not underestimate how important this covenant is held by the faculty and by the Institute. In the past, there are cases where students that have breached this covenant and were referred to the Committee on Discipline ended up being required to leave MIT.</p> <p>A short non-exhaustive list of examples that constitute a breach of academic honesty:</p> <ul>     <li>Carrying prohibited crib sheets or calculator programs into a quiz.</li>     <li>Submitting homework in whole or in part that is not generated by you. (Copied from another source.)</li>     <li>Submitting another student's work as your own.</li>     <li>Referring to prohibited reference material during a quiz.</li>     <li>Promulgate or willingly receive information on a quiz prior to its general dissemination to the class by the faculty.</li>     <li>Engaging in any behavior to reduce the grade or performance of another student.</li>     <li>Engaging in behavior to illegitimately obtain course materials before they are issued to the class by the faculty.</li> </ul> <p>Further discussion and links on these issues can be found on the <a href=\"http://meche.mit.edu/ethics\">Mechanical Engineering Department's Ethics and Integrity webpage</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"}},{"id":"546b52b5-18bf-57e3-b290-2cf260ddd39e","trackingTitle":"2.051 - Calendar","title":"Calendar","url":"/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-051-introduction-to-heat-transfer-fall-2015/calendar","shortUrl":"calendar","coursePageType":"CourseSection","text":{"text":"<h2 class=\"subhead\">Session Key</h2> <p>L = Lecture<br />R = Recitation<br />Q = Quiz</p>   <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table summary=\"See table caption for summary.\" class=\"tablewidth100\">     <caption class=\"invisible\">Course calendar.</caption>  <!-- BEGIN TABLE HEADER (for MIT OCW Table Template 2.51) -->     <thead>         <tr>             <th scope=\"col\">SES&nbsp;#</th>             <th scope=\"col\">TOPICS</th>             <th scope=\"col\">KEY&nbsp;DATES</th>         </tr>     </thead>     <!-- END TABLE HEADER -->     <tbody>         <tr class=\"row\">             <td>L1</td>             <td>Introduction to Heat Transfer, Conduction, Fourier's Law</td>             <td>&nbsp;</td>         </tr>         <tr class=\"alt-row\">             <td>L2</td>             <td>Conduction, Convection, and Radiation</td>             <td>Problem Set 1 assigned</td>         </tr>         <tr class=\"row\">             <td>R1</td>             <td>Recitation</td>             <td>&nbsp;</td>         </tr>         <tr class=\"alt-row\">             <td>L3</td>             <td>Thermal Resistance Networks and Examples</td>             <td>&nbsp;</td>         </tr>         <tr class=\"row\">             <td>L4</td>             <td>Heat Transfer Enhancement&mdash;Fins &amp;

Examples of possible topics are: cell phones and brain cancer; endocrine disrupters; food additives; diesel exhaust and asthma incidence; a disease cluster associated with a specific chemical. <strong>Do&nbsp;not select a&nbsp;chemical or agent discussed in&nbsp;class.</strong>&nbsp;Ideally, choose a topic on the basis of a recent report(s) in major lay-media such as newspapers, radio talk shows, news magazines, television news, or web alerts.</p> <p>By 5 p.m. on Lecture 9, teams must submit a one-page proposal of their project outlining the specific responsibilities of each team member for the final report components (see component details below).&nbsp;The proposal should be submitted to Prof. Sherley.&nbsp;Project proposals will be reviewed by all three professors.&nbsp;Students will be notified of approval decisions as soon as possible. If a proposal is found to be unacceptable, a team will have until the beginning of class on&nbsp;Lecture 11&nbsp;to develop an acceptable proposal.&nbsp;Teams are highly encouraged to confer with professors and the TA regarding the acceptability of possible topics&nbsp;<strong>before</strong> submission of their proposals.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Project Updates</h3> <p>During the last half of the course, teams must schedule at least two meetings with the TA or Professors to discuss progress on their project.&nbsp;Notify Prof. Sherley&nbsp;after each of these meetings has occurred.&nbsp;Both meetings must be completed before Lecture 22.&nbsp;Failure to schedule these meetings will result in a 20% reduction for the final project grade.&nbsp;These meetings need not be lengthy.&nbsp;Ideally, all team members should attend, and teams should bring relevant information and questions/problems they may have encountered during the development of their project paper and presentation. In addition, the team should prepare a brief update of progress on the project.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">The Paper</h3> <p>Each team is expected to develop a paper that provides an in-depth analysis of their project topic.&nbsp;More is expected than a book report or review.&nbsp;The paper should entail a critical evaluation of the quality, credibility, and substance of readings and information sources, and arrive at a final position regarding the topic.&nbsp;This position should specifically address the question of whether the topic agent is likely to be responsible for an adverse human health outcome.&nbsp;The final position of the paper should be based on a critical assessment of available data, information, and principles of epidemiology, biostatistics, and toxicology developed in the course.&nbsp;The paper should also consider important factors that may influence public opinion and health policy regarding the topic agent.</p> <p>The paper should be at least 20 double-spaced pages (no more than 25) inclusive of:&nbsp;(1) a cover page with title (that succinctly states the topic) and team member names; (2) an abstract/summary page; (3) main text; and (4) references.&nbsp;All team members are expected to participate in writing the main text of the paper, with each member taking responsibility for the development of a different main section.&nbsp;The organization of the main text is left to the discretion of each team, but the following 5 components should include in all reports.</p> <ol> <li>Discussion of the environmental history of the topic agent.&nbsp;The accuracy of historical records or accounts of the topic agent should be critically evaluated.</li> <li>Discussion of the known or proposed toxic mechanism of the topic agent.&nbsp;The quality and rigor of cited journal articles should be critically evaluated.</li> <li>Discussion and position on the case for a cause-effect relationship between the topic agent and adverse human health effects.&nbsp;The quality and interpretation of key epidemiological studies and biostatistical analyses should be evaluated.&nbsp;An exhaustive meta-analysis should not be produced.&nbsp;From thorough research, students should identify and discuss the main research articles that have driven current views on the topic. However, papers, which may be cited less often, that counter the conclusions of key &quot;thought-leader papers&quot; should also be considered.</li> <li>Critical evaluation of lay-media reports and public opinion regarding the likelihood that the topic agent is an environmental toxicant that poses a risk for adverse human health effects.</li> <li>Evaluation of government regulations for use of the topic agent and exposure limits.</li> </ol> <p>The goal of the team effort is to produce an integrated, cohesive, critical evaluation of the potential environmental health impact of the selected topic agent.&nbsp;Simply pasting together individual blocks of information is undesirable. The following strategy should be adopted: Agree on individual responsibilities; do the individual research; discuss findings in team meetings; integrate ideas; write sections; assemble sections; everyone review preliminary drafts to refine integration and continuity; finalize; and submit.</p> <p>References should be cited in the text and organized in the reference section numerically in order of appearance.&nbsp;The format for the references should include: for journal articles - authors (list up to five; thereafter use et al.), article title, year, journal, volume, and pages; for books - same as journals with addition of book title, editor(s), edition, publisher, publication city; and for websites - URL, organization posting the website, year produced, authors (if known).</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">The Final Presentation</h3> <p>Each presentation should be targeted for 15 minutes, with all members of the team sharing approximately equally in the presentation.&nbsp;Expect to have your presentation curtailed by Prof. Sherley if it runs longer than 17 minutes. At 15 minutes, you will be given a 2-minute warning for ending. The remaining time (8-10 minutes) is reserved for your team to address questions from the instructors and classmates.&nbsp;Transparencies and the chalkboard may be used for graphics, but no forms of computer projection are allowable.</p> <p>Following are example final team project papers, presented courtesy of the authors, used with permission.</p> <p>Rupali Avasare, Christina Fuentes, and Lynn Ngo. &quot;An investigation into the supposed link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.&quot; (<a href=\"./resolveuid/26d21a6536ccc6e798c6f6f2a3a06886\">PDF</a>)</p> <p>Lisa An, Sueann Lee, and Erin Mathewson. &quot;Electromagnetic Fields (EMFs) and Childhood Leukemia.&quot; (<a href=\"./resolveuid/7de0c0f41ed9c7d3dd7f490d66b26384\">PDF</a>)</p>"}},{"id":"09620648-d293-5c5c-8359-5881ba1361c4","trackingTitle":"20.104J - Study Materials","title":"Study Materials","url":"/courses/biological-engineering/20-104j-chemicals-in-the-environment-toxicology-and-public-health-be-104j-spring-2005/study-materials","shortUrl":"study-materials","coursePageType":"CourseSection","text":{"text":"<p>Following are three quizzes from previous terms.</p> <p>Practice Quiz 1 (<a href=\"./resolveuid/4bff96343cf8ac64b95194d46ac10498\">PDF</a>)</p> <p>Practice Quiz 2 (<a href=\"./resolveuid/ba94cc99daa624374ca96545d166bda4\">PDF</a>)</p> <p>Practice Quiz 3 (<a href=\"./resolveuid/6e2799e6840a4845e0a625b147680210\">PDF</a>)</p>"}},{"id":"952ae0bf-ae7c-5d00-a497-1166f8e65d88","trackingTitle":"20.104J - Download Course Materials","title":"Download Course Materials","url":"/courses/biological-engineering/20-104j-chemicals-in-the-environment-toxicology-and-public-health-be-104j-spring-2005/download-course-materials","shortUrl":"download-course-materials","coursePageType":"DownloadSection","text":{"text":"<div id=\"download_inner_main\"><p class=\"ptext\">This package contains the same content as the online version of the course, except for any audio/video materials and other interactive file types.</p><p class=\"ptext\">For help downloading and using course materials, read our <a href=\"http://ocw.mit.edu/help/faq-technology/\">frequently asked questions</a>.</p></div>"}}]}},{"node":{"id":"e1fec463-100c-5e46-b153-6802f06c1438","trackingTitle":"22.01 - Introduction to Nuclear Engineering and Ionizing Radiation","title":"Introduction to Nuclear Engineering and Ionizing Radiation","masterCourseNumber":"01","imageSrc":"https://open-learning-course-data-rc.s3.amazonaws.com/22-01-introduction-to-nuclear-engineering-and-ionizing-radiation-fall-2015/a9e31b57bcd2540fe7591e566a5d462f_22-01f15.jpg","imageDescription":{"imageDescription":"Cherenkov radiation, caused by beta particles moving through water faster than the speed of light, creates this blue glow in the core of the Idaho National Laboratory Advanced Test Reactor.

Professor Michael Short in Fall 2015.</p> <p>This course is a hands-on approach to ionizing radiation. Radiation is the central aspect that makes nuclear science and engineering (NSE) its own discipline, and sets the foundation for almost all of modern physics. The course begins by retracing the steps of famous radiation experiments and hypotheses. Next, the stage is set for the study of radiation, by showing details of the systems and reactors that use radiation. The remaining portion of the course is dedicated to describing the origins, interactions, uses, detection, and biological/chemical effects of ionizing radiation.</p></div> <div class=\"onethird\"><h2 class=\"title\">Course Outcomes</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Course Goals for Students</h3> <ul>     <li>Develop fluency in basic nuclear physics</li>     <li>Learn about seminal radiation experiments and hypotheses</li>     <li>Explore systems and reactors that use radiation</li>     <li>Describe the origins, interactions, uses, detection, and biological/chemical effects of ionizing radiation</li>     <li>Apply knowledge of nuclear physics to evaluate quality of scientific claims</li> </ul></div> <div class=\"onethird omega\"><h2 class=\"title\">Curriculum Information</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Prerequisites</h3> <p>This course, which is the first subject in the Nuclear Science and Engineering undergraduate degree sequence, has no prerequisites.

this section, Professor Michael Short describes his approach to introducing students to nuclear physics.</em></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The students who take this class are mainly sophomores who are majoring in nuclear engineering. But about a quarter or a third are people majoring in other things like Computer Science or Mechanical Engineering, who want to get a flavor of nuclear science. In fact, it's the first modern physics class these folks will take at MIT, because GIRs <img src=\"/images/educator/icon-question-gir.png\" class=\"question\" alt=\"\" /> taken by all freshmen are classical mechanics and classical electricity and magnetism. So you come here to the center of high learning, and you learn stuff that's 150 years old! <em>22.01 Introduction to Nuclear Engineering and Ionizing Radiation</em> is their first experience with things that are two digits years old, and still evolving now.

For example, you see a lot of MIT students with &ldquo;<em>E = mc<sup>2</sup></em>&rdquo; on their T-shirts. Many of them get to this class and realize they don't really know what that means. They have trouble reconciling the fact that matter is energy and vice versa, and that you can convert from one to the other, and that's the whole idea behind radioactive decay and transmutation. So that process takes three or four weeks—to really hammer in with enough examples for them to understand.</p>\r\n<p>Then they do get the equivalency between matter and energy, and they're able to understand not just that things undergo alpha or beta decay, but why. Why some elements do, and some don't, has to do with the amount of excess energy or the binding energy of the nucleus, and what the origin of those decays comes from.  They can start to really understand, well, why does this element have a short half-life? Oh, because it's fairly unstable. So it's got a lot of excess energy, and it really wants to decay to something more stable, so it will do it faster. </p>\r\n"}},{"id":"f0304baa-27af-5212-8310-f07fe2246a68","trackingTitle":"22.01 - Developing Student Fluency, Not Just Familiarity","title":"Developing Student Fluency, Not Just Familiarity","url":"/courses/nuclear-engineering/22-01-introduction-to-nuclear-engineering-and-ionizing-radiation-fall-2015/instructor-insights/developing-student-fluency-not-just-familiarity","shortUrl":"developing-student-fluency-not-just-familiarity","coursePageType":"CourseSection","text":{"text":"<p><em>In this section, Professor Michael Short describes he emphasizes developing fluency in basic nuclear physics, content that nuclear engineers must &ldquo;know like instinct&rdquo;.</em></p>  <div class=\"pullquote\" style=\"float: right; margin: -4px 0 auto 20px; padding-left: 20px; width: 250px; border-right: none; border-left: 1px solid #D5C9BA;\"><p class=\"quote\">This is the kind of stuff that, without batting an eye, you should know, just as you know gravity is 9.8 meters per second squared.</p> <p class=\"sig\">&mdash; Michael Short</p></div> <p><em>22.01 Introduction to Nuclear Engineering and Ionizing Radiation</em>, more than any other course in the department, is the one that every nuclear scientist and engineer has to know like instinct.

Month one is getting to know <em>E = mc<sup>2</sup></em> and radioactive decay, and the basic kinematics of what happens when a particle elastically collides with another one. Month two is how radiation interacts with matter: How is energy transferred? How does a photon interact? How does a neutron interact? How does an electron interact? Why are they different? And not only what are the formulas for their interactions, strength, and energies, but where do the formulas come from? We do derivations there.</p> <p>Finally, month three is kind of a hodgepodge of nuclear medicine, biological and chemical effects, and then some societal and policy aspects, like models for dose versus cancer risk, or acute effects of radiation poisoning. If you want to understand why certain types of radiation are more damaging to biological tissue, you go right to their stopping power, which is their differential energy transfer and their range in matter (like our bodies). Then you can understand why alpha particles, the heavy helium nuclei, are so dangerous when you ingest them, but harmless outside the body.

We had more derivations than I've used in previous years, not because I want them to do derivations that fill the board, but because I want them to understand. For example, we have this crazy expression for radiation stopping power and matter. You can figure out where it comes from by just breaking things down into differential force balance. It's just like many other problems here: break it down, integrate over whatever real system you have, and you tend to get the crazy formulas that are right.

And I said, &ldquo;Well, why don't you use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_equivalent_dose\">banana-equivalent dose</a>, the dose of radioactive potassium you get from eating one banana, which everyone will agree is a perfectly safe level?&quot; Then you can compare the radiation dose from other normal and abnormal activities to how many bananas would you have eaten.

To measure the radiation, you first need to convert the raw bananas to ash, to create a concentrated sample. At first I wanted to just give the students the ashes and save them the time. So I called all the crematoriums in the Boston area. And they all said &ldquo;No,&rdquo; except one. But when the manager found out that the guy had said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Absolutely not.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>So my plan to give them the ashes failed. I said, &ldquo;All right, everyone's going to take 50 bananas home, peel them, burn them at a low heat,&rdquo; so the ashes would contain the potassium we want to concentrate.</p>\r\n<p>So they all burned them. We crushed them into chunks and powder, and we counted them in the spectrometer at the nuclear reactor lab. And you could see some very clear potassium-40 peaks. Then you could integrate the area underneath and get the total radioactivity of that mass of bananas.</p>\r\n<p>The students loved it.

Is rationality--the notion of a good reason to believe something--relative to cultural norms? What are selves? Is there a coherent form of relativism about the self? Guided by the writings of Thomas Kuhn, Gilbert Harman, Judith Thomson, John Perry and Derek Parfit, we attempt to make these vague questions precise, and we make a start at answering them.</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Graded Assignments</h2><p>You will submit 20 pages of written work (as required by HASS-D regulations). These will be divided among 4 papers (the HASS-D requirement is at least 3).</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Expectations</h2><p>Feel free to discuss the writing assignments&nbsp;-- and, of course, also the reading assignments -- with each other. But (as you don't need me to tell you) the written work you submit must be entirely your own. Your papers should not contain quotations masquerading as paraphrases. A statement of ideas from one of the assigned authors must be couched in your own words. Do not use any footnotes. There will be no prizes for writing in anything other than plain English. There is only one route to a good grade: thinking hard about the issues, and formulating and defending definite opinions.</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Debates</h2><p>The course divides into three parts. At the end of each part we will hold an in-class debate. Everyone is expected to participate. Yummy snacks are a distinct possibility.</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Examination</h2><p>HASS-D regulations require a 3-hour final exam covering material dealt with throughout the term. The exam will be open book but not open notes, at a time and place to be announced. There will be no midterm exam.</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2><div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"><caption class=\"invisible\">Grading table.</caption><thead><tr class=\"tableheader\"><th id=\"col1\" scope=\"col\" abbr=\"Week Number\">ACTIVITIES</th><th id=\"col2\" scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"row\"><td headers=\"col1\">Papers</td><td headers=\"col2\">60%</td></tr><tr class=\"alt-row\"><td headers=\"col1\">Final Exam</td><td headers=\"col2\">25%</td></tr><tr class=\"row\"><td headers=\"col1\">Class Participation</td><td headers=\"col2\">5%</td></tr><tr class=\"alt-row\"><td headers=\"col1\">Section Participation and Quizzes</td><td headers=\"col2\">10%</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><br />&nbsp;</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Subject Matter</h2><p>This course is primarily intended for students who have not had any previous exposure to philosophy. It treats a small number of important philosophical questions in some depth. (For more breadth and less depth, try <a href=\"/courses/linguistics-and-philosophy/24-00-problems-in-philosophy-fall-2010\">24.00</a>, Problems of philosophy.)</p><ol><li>What are persons? Soul pellets, living bodies, brains, or what?<br />It comes naturally to think that whether you <strong>survive</strong> some upcoming event (say a heart operation) is a yes or no question, and a question of great importance: death is a hard fact and a bad thing. Derek Parfit argues in <em>Reasons and Persons</em> that the right answer to (1) implies that there is sometimes no fact of the matter as to whether you survive; also that you sometimes (even when there is a fact of the matter) ought not to care about not surviving, since death is as good as life. Our first few weeks will be devoted to Parfit's argument and critical reactions to it.<br /><br />&nbsp;</li><li>Are moral standards absolute or in some sense &quot;relative&quot;?<br />Harman and Thomson's <em>Moral Relativism and Moral Objectivity</em> takes the form of a debate about the question (Harman being the moral relativist, and Thomson the moral objectivist). It is self contained, and mostly clear and accessible. The goal is to read and discuss a good chunk of the book.<br /><br />&nbsp;</li><li>Is the truth about external reality absolute or relative to one's point of view?<br />Science seems to show that external objects are not colored or sweet in themselves but only in relation to human observers (Blackburn). This concedes to science the task of saying what objects are like &quot;in themselves.&quot; But Thomas Kuhn's <em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em> casts doubt even on that. Is the world really a certain way or are competing perspectives on it equally valid?</li></ol><h2 class=\"subhead\">Aim</h2><p>By the end of the course you should be able to see your way through the swirling fog of metaphor that often surrounds these issues to a reasonably precise formulation of the central questions. You should also have some familiarity with the way in which a philosophical problem arises, and techniques by means of which one might try to solve it. And, with a bit of luck, you might even end up with philosophical views yourself.</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Feedback</h2><p>Your comments and criticism, expressed either to myself or the TAs, are <strong>extremely welcome</strong>.</p>"}},{"id":"3ffccbc8-e000-5bb1-b0d5-62b24c570c3d","trackingTitle":"24.03 -

Would a &quot;same body, same brain&quot; principle be any easier to know? (two pages).</p> <p>Weirob claims that immaterial souls, if they existed, would be totally irrelevant to questions of personal identity and survival. Is she right? Why or why not?

What is Parfit's own answer to this question?</p> <p>Suppose you are now offered the choice between stepping into the teletransporter, and taking a more conventional, but much more expensive and time consuming, spaceship to Mars.</p> <p>According to Parfit, it would be irrational of you to take the spaceship, even on the assumption that you would not survive teletransportation.

Thomson is not convinced this is possible. She considers three types of case in which a moral fact might seem to explain a nonmoral fact. A nonmoral fact might, she says, seem to explain &quot;a person's having a certain belief, or doing such and such, or having such and such an attitude,&quot; say, discontent (87ff). Give examples (your own, not from the text) of alleged explanations of each type. What do you think Thomson's response would be to each of your examples? Are you convinced?

If you are not convinced, then where do you think Thomson is going wrong?</li>     <li>What is cognitivism about morality? What are some examples of non-cognitivist views about morality? Explain the Humean argument for non-cognitivism in your own words. Does the Humean argument succeed? How do Chilly and Very Chilly fit in (pp. 117-120)?

Are they in your view really possible?</li>     <li>Let the following be the <strong>Relativity Thesis</strong>: <em>Sentences of the form: 'it would be morally wrong of P to D' have no truth value considered independently of any context of utterance.</em> For example, suppose Adam is deciding whether or not to be cloned. Then, in one context of utterance, 'it would be morally wrong of Adam to be cloned' is true, while in another context that sentence is false. (Compare 'P is tall', 'P is moving', etc.) Harman thinks that the <strong>Relativity Thesis</strong> is a &quot;reasonable inference&quot; from the &quot;most plausible explanation of moral diversity&quot;. Which explanation does Harman think is most plausible? Is he right? Is the <strong>Relativity Thesis</strong> a reasonable inference from Harman's favored explanation of moral diversity?</li> </ol> <p><em>Remember:</em> give reasons for your answers.

Einstein's gravitational theory had led to the result that light must be attracted by heavy bodies (such as the sun), precisely as material bodies were attracted. As a consequence it could be calculated that light from a distant fixed star whose apparent position was close to the sun would reach the earth from such a direction that the star would seem to be slightly shifted away from the sun; or in other words, that stars close to the sun would look as if they had moved a little away from the sun, and from one another. This is a thing which cannot normally be observed since such stars are rendered invisible in daytime by the sun's overwhelming brightness; but during an eclipse it is possible to take photographs of them. If the same constellation is photographed at night one can measure the distances on the two photographs, and check the predicted effect. Now the impressive thing about this case is the <em>risk</em> involved in a prediction of this kind. If observation shows that the predicted effect is definitely absent, then the theory is simply refuted. The theory is <em>incompatible with certain possible results of observation</em>--in fact with results which everybody before Einstein would have expected... These considerations led me in the winter of 1919-20 to conclusions which I may now reformulate as follows....<br />     <br />     -- A theory which is not refutable by any conceivable event is non-scientific. Irrefutability is not a virtue of a theory (as people often think) but a vice. <br />     <br />     -- Every genuine <em>test</em> of a theory is an attempt to falsify it, or to refute it. Testability is falsifiability; but there are degrees of testability: some theories are more testable, more exposed to refutation, than others; they take, as it were, greater risks.<br />     <br />     One can sum up all this by saying that the &quot;<em>criterion of the scientific status of a theory is its falsifiability, or refutability, or testability</em>.&quot; <br />     <br />     Explain Popper's main points in this quotation. How would Putnam or Kuhn react to this picture of science (pick one)? Is Popper right? Are the criticisms Putnam or Kuhn would make correct? Or is Popper wrong for other reasons?</li>     <li>Kuhn says that theories are not tested, but rather presupposed, during periods of normal science. What does he mean by this? Is it true? Why does our confidence in a theory grow over these periods, if the theory is not really put to the test?</li>     <li>Is Kuhn right to suggest that scientists working under different paradigms have different experiences of the world? Is he right to infer from this that the worlds they experience are not the same? How is such a view to be reconciled with the common sense notion that we now know more about the world than, say, Ptolemy? If he is not right, what is the truth he is groping for?</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"subhead\"><a id=\"debates\" name=\"debates\"></a>Debates</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Debate 1</h3> <p>Week 5, Class 2.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Debate Motion</h3> <p>Teletransportation is about as bad as ordinary death.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Debate 2</h3> <p>Week 9, Class 2.</p> <p>Is abortion morally permissible? People disagree vehemently about the answer to this question. Yet the dispute appears intractable: the arguments advanced by each side rarely (if ever) persuade anyone to change his or her mind, let alone resolve the issue.</p> <p>Some possible explanations for this are:</p> <ol>     <li><strong>People on one side of the debate are just stupid or irrational</strong>. For example, someone may accept the premises of a valid argument, yet refuse to believe the conclusion. Or she may fail more generally to connect some of her beliefs together (see Thomson on &quot;Walling Off.&quot; page 205).</li>     <li><strong>The issue is very complex and difficult</strong>. Issues about abortion are connected to many other important issues, and it is not even clear what is relevant or not relevant to the question of its permissibility. Rational, intelligent people can disagree about complex issues simply because they are hard to understand (Thomson. page 205).</li>     <li><strong>Some people are not as well placed as others to discover the truth because they have very different background experiences and beliefs</strong>. &quot;Different people with different starting points will rationally respond in different ways to the same evidence. There is no guarantee that people who start sufficiently far apart in belief will tend to converge in view as the evidence comes in&quot; (Harman. page 12).</li>     <li><strong>Moral relativism (something like Harman's version) is correct.</strong></li> </ol> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Debate Proposition</h3> <p>The fourth point&nbsp;is the best explanation for the intractability of the dispute about abortion.</p>"}},{"id":"9f227239-4671-5516-a675-ed49fbb670ca","trackingTitle":"24.03 - Exams","title":"Exams","url":"/courses/linguistics-and-philosophy/24-03-relativism-reason-and-reality-spring-2005/exams","shortUrl":"exams","coursePageType":"CourseSection","text":{"text":"\n<h2 class=\"subhead\">Exam Study Questions</h2>\n<p></p>\n<ol>\n<li>What was Locke's theory of personal identity (as presented in class)? What was Reid's objection to it (as presented in class)? What was Butler's objection (according to Parfit's first interpretation in section 80 of <em>Reasons and Persons</em>)? How can the theory be fixed to avoid these problems? Explain how the case of someone who suffers from total amnesia presents a problem for the revised theory. Is there a fix? Is any kind of neo-Lockean theory of personal identity plausible?\n</li>\n<li>The \"people photocopier\" produces one exact duplicate of the person who walks into it, instantly and painlessly destroying the original in the process (so you do not survive walking into the people photocopier). According to some theories of personal identity, there could not be a people photocopier: if the copier produces one exact duplicate, then the original person was not destroyed--she is the duplicate. Explain what these theories are (hint: consider some different candidates for Parfit's \"relation R\"). Are they all false, or is one true? Suppose that there is a people photocopier, and that your dear friend could be copied in her sleep without her knowledge, the duplicate receiving some great reward. It's your call: do you allow you friend to be copied (without consulting her) or not? Why or why not?\n</li>\n<li>According to Parfit, \"personal identity is not what matters\" (p. 255). What does Parfit mean by this? Is he right that I would not survive a successful \"double brain transplant\" in which half of my brain goes into body A and half into body B? Why or why not? Is he right that I would survive an unsuccessful \"double brain transplant\" in which the half of my brain intended for body B is instead accidentally crushed? Why or why not? Is he right that I would have reason to prefer the second outcome, if personal identity mattered? Why or why not? Do you agree with Parfit that the second outcome is not intrinsically preferable? What do you conclude from all this?\n</li>\n<li>Assuming that identity indeed does not matter, how should our attitudes change? Should we be less concerned about our own deaths? Should we withdraw our support from medical research aimed at prolonging human life? What other changes are indicated?\n</li>\n<li>Thomson says that a fact is \"operative\" relative to a given effect if it helps to explain that effect. According to Thomson, are moral facts ever \"operative\" relative to non-moral facts? Does Sturgeon agree? Who do you think is correct, and why? How does your answer bear on the possibility of moral knowledge?\n</li>\n<li>What is emotivism? What does the emotivist think we are doing when we call an outcome bad or an action wrong? Set out what in your opinion is the strongest argument for emotivism, and the strongest argument against. Which do you find more convincing? Why?\n</li>\n<li>People disagree on the question of whether abortion is morally permissible. Yet the dispute appears intractable: the arguments advanced by each side rarely (if ever) persuade anyone to change his or her mind, let alone resolve the issue. What are some possible explanations for this? What is the relativist's explanation? Why aren't there similarly intractable disagreements about velocity if, as Harman says, moral claims resemble velocity claims in being relative to a particular point of view?\n</li>\n<li>What is the difference between Popper's \"deductivism,\" also known as \"falsificationism,\" and the usual \"inductivist\" view of science? What are the advantages Popper sees for his own proposal? What are some of the disadvantages that Putnam sees? Which view do you think is more plausible, deductivism or inductivism? Why?\n</li>\n<li>Kuhn thinks that debates over paradigm choice are characterized by \"an incompleteness of logical contact.\" He says in a similar vein that \"Schools guided by different paradigms are always slightly at cross purposes.\" What are some of the specific obstacles Kuhn sees to direct debate about the relative merits of old and new paradigms? Do corresponding problems ever arise outside of science? Try to explain the kinds of obstacle Kuhn has in mind in your own words, using examples from science and ordinary life. How in practice do people attempt to work around these obstacles?\n</li>\n<li>\"What does Kuhn mean when he says that (i) \"[t]he transfer of allegiance from paradigm to paradigm is a conversion experience that cannot be forced,\" and (ii) \"[i]nsofar as he is engaged in normal science, the research worker is a solver of puzzles, not a tester of paradigms\"? Elaborate on these claims. Do you think they are plausible? Why or why not? Suppose claims (i) and (ii) are correct. Should we conclude that a new scientific theory is not a more faithful or accurate representation of the world than the theory it replaces?</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 class=\"subhead\">Exam</h2>\n<p>Week 15 (but don't take my word for it, check the schedule).</p>\n<p>The exam is open book, closed notes, and will consist of three of these questions, chosen by us.</p>\n<p>NB: you will be penalized for answering a question by quoting, or lightly paraphrasing a quotation, from the readings or the handouts.

class=\"subhead\">Guidelines for Papers</h2> <ol> <li>All papers should be neatly typed. Be sure to include your name on your paper. For safety, keep copies of your papers. <strong>Please number your pages</strong>. Papers should be turned in at the time and date indicated on the syllabus and on the paper topics.</li> <li>All papers should be within the length guidelines specified. If you have more to say than you can fit within the page limits, pare down your discussion: make sure you have stayed on topic, focus your discussion on the most important points for your argument. However, note that because this is a HASS-D course, you must write a total of <strong>20 pages</strong> over the course of the term.</li> <li>Essay topics must be taken from the list distributed in class, and your paper should be on <strong>one</strong> topic only. Stick closely to the topic; be sure you address the question asked. On some occasions your TA <strong>may</strong> approve an alternative paper topic. If you are interested in writing on a topic of your own, speak to your TA well in advance of the paper deadline.</li> <li>If you wish to attribute a position to a philosopher we have discussed, be sure to check that the text supports your attribution. On controversial points you should cite textual evidence, e.g., by quotation, or by giving the line numbers of relevant texts in parentheses. It is <strong>imperative</strong> that you indicate when you are quoting or paraphrasing an author, and when you do you <strong>must</strong> cite references to the original text. Failure to do so counts as plagiarism and will be handled accordingly. However, points made in lecture or in class handouts are &quot;common property&quot; for students in this class and may be relied upon in your papers without citation. (More on plagiarism, see below.)</li> <li>Although quotes are helpful, please keep quotation to a minimum. The paper should be, by in large, <strong>in your own words</strong>.</li> <li>You do not need to consult additional secondary sources. If you do, this <strong>must</strong> be acknowledged in the paper. If you quote or paraphrase a secondary source, this must be attributed to the author; if you relied on texts in your preparation which were not assigned in class, include reference to them in a bibliography at the end of the paper (even if you don't quote from them). (More on plagiarism, see below.)</li> <li>Papers are due at the date and time specified. After that time papers will be considered late and will be penalized. If you foresee special difficulties with the deadline, speak to the instructor well in advance.</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Plagiarism</h2> <p>To put it bluntly, plagiarism is theft and fraud--it is the theft of someone else's ideas, words, approach, and phrasing; it's fraud because the writer is trying to profit (a grade) by claiming as his/her own someone else's work.</p> <p>Plagiarism results in a zero for the work submitted, so it's crucial to understand the concept. Just as scientists demand complete and accurate information about experiments so that they duplicate and check those experiments, so scholars and readers demand complete information so they can check your use of sources and accuracy in reporting what others said. In all academic writing, then, you must give complete citations (e.g., author, title, source, page) each time you use someone else's ideas, words, phrasing, or unusual information. An insidious form of plagiarism is the &quot;patchwork paper&quot;--some words and ideas taken from source A are stitched together with words and ideas from source B and source C and....</p> <p>Your essays should be your own work, although you are encouraged to seek writing advice from the Writing and Communication Center. If there is any question about whether the student's paper is his or her own work, TA's have been directed to bring the paper directly to the professor. Every effort will be made to determine whether the paper is plagiarized. This is an attempt to be fair to the teachers and the other students in the course.</p> <p>There are 4 guidelines for using sources in your essays:</p> <ul> <li>There is never a good reason to paraphrase a source--either summarize it in your own words or quote it exactly (citing the source in either case).</li> <li>When you quote, quote exactly, use quotation marks, and cite the source.</li> <li>When you use information that might not be considered common knowledge, cite the source.</li> <li>When in doubt about whether or not to give a citation, always give a citation.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Additional Information</h3> <p><a href=\"http://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center/avoiding-plagiarism/\">Citing and Using Sources</a></p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Topics for the First Paper</h2> <p>Write a short essay of 4-5 pages (1200-1500 words) on&nbsp;<strong>one</strong> of the following topics. Papers are due 2 days after Lecture 10. You may hand in your paper (note that the office closes at 5pm!), or email it to me, preferably as a Word attachment. In writing your papers, please attend to the guidelines handed out in lecture. Students may write on a topic of their own design if it is submitted in writing and approved in advance.</p> <ol> <li>In the <em>Apology</em>, Socrates maintains that if the jury were to let him off on the condition that he stop philosophizing, he would nevertheless disobey the order and continue philosophizing (e.g., 29d2-4). In the <em>Crito</em>, however, Socrates claims, <p><em>Is your wisdom such as not to realize that your country is to be honored more than your mother, your father, and all your ancestors&hellip;? You must either persuade it or obey its orders, and endure in silence whatever it instructs you to endure, whether blows or bonds, and if it leads you into war to be wounded or killed, you must obey. To do so is right&hellip; (51a6-6)</em></p> <p>Is there a contradiction between the position Socrates defends in the <em>Apology</em> and the one he defends in the <em>Crito</em>? Is it possible to reconcile the two views? If so, explain how. If not, how do you explain Socrates' apparent willingness to contradict himself? Would Socrates have behaved justly if he had continued to philosophize against the order of the court?</p></li> <li>At several points in the dialogues Socrates suggests that it is not possible to harm a good person. E.g., he says in the <em>Apology</em>, &quot;&hellip;keep this one truth in mind, that a good man cannot be harmed either in life or in death. (41c8-d1, also 30c7-d5) Explain Socrates' reasons for this surprising claim. Do you agree? Why or why not?</li> <li>In the <em>Euthyphro</em>, Socrates asks the question &quot;what is piety?&quot;. Euthyphro's proposes that the pious is what is dear to the gods (7a1). Discuss Socrates' arguments against this answer. In doing so, indicate what requirements Socrates places on definition, and how Euthyphro's answer fails to meet these requirements.</li> <li>In the <em>Meno</em>, Socrates develops his doctrine of recollection at least in part as a response to the paradox of inquiry. What is the paradox of inquiry? What is the doctrine of recollection? Does the doctrine of recollection solve the problem posed by the paradox of inquiry? Can you offer a better solution?</li> <li>In the <em>Meno</em>, there is a passage that begins and ends as follows: <em>77c: Socrates: Do you not think, my good man, that all men desire good things?<br /> Meno: I do not&hellip; 78b: Meno: You are probably right, Socrates, and no one wants what is bad.<br /> </em><br /> By what steps does Socrates persuade Meno to change his mind between 77c and 78b? Do you agree with the conclusion? If not, what do you think is wrong with the argument?</li> <li>In the <em>Phaedo</em>, Simmias argues that the soul might be like a harmony, something invisible and without body, yet dependent on an instrument such as a lyre, just as our soul is dependent on our body. He continues, <p><em>If then the soul is a kind of harmony or attunement, clearly, when our body is relaxed or stretched without due measure by diseases and other evils, the soul must immediately be destroyed, even if it be most divine, as are the other harmonies found in music and all the works of artists, and the remains of each body last for a long time until they rot or are burned. Consider what we shall say in answer to one who deems the soul to be a mixture of bodily elements and to be the first to perish in the process we call death. (86c2-d2)</em></p> <p>What arguments does Socrates provide in response to this challenge? Is he able to establish in the <em>Phaedo</em>, contrary to Simmias's suggestion, that the soul is not like a harmony &quot;the first to perish&quot;, but is immortal? Critically evaluate Socrates' response; is there something Simmias might have said in response? Do you find Socrates' arguments convincing? Why or why not?</p></li></ol> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Topics for Second Paper</h2> <p>Write a 5-7 page (1500-2100 word) paper on&nbsp;<strong>one</strong> of the following topics. Papers are due 2 days after Lecture 18 (you may email it to me). Be sure that your paper has a clear and comprehensible <strong>thesis</strong>; that it contains <strong>arguments</strong> for that thesis; and that it anticipates and responds to likely <strong>criticisms</strong>. Remember that as an interpreter it is your responsibility to show Plato's ideas in their strongest and most plausible form, while remaining true to the text.</p> <ol> <li>In Book II of the <em>Republic</em>, Glaucon uses the story of Gyges (359c-360b) to take up the challenges presented by Thrasymachus in Book I. Glaucon suggests that most would take the story to show that, <p><em>[O]ne is never just willingly but only when compelled to be. No one believes justice to be a good when it is kept private, since, wherever either person thinks he can do injustice with impunity, he does it. Indeed, every man believes that injustice is far more profitable to himself than justice.&quot; (360c4-8).</em></p> <p>Over the course of the <em>Republic</em>, however, Socrates undertakes to defend the view that injustice is <strong>not</strong> more profitable than justice, and that justice is good both for its own sake and for its consequences. What is Socrates' argument? Does it convincingly show that a person with Gyges' ring would benefit more from behaving justly than behaving unjustly?</p></li> <li>Explain and discuss Plato's argument for the division of the soul into three parts (<em>Republic</em> 434d-441c). Do you find his arguments convincing? Considering his theory of the tripartite soul, discuss&nbsp;<strong>one</strong> of the following two questions:<br /> <ul> <li>Does his division of the soul into three parts enable Plato to solve the problem of weakness of will (akrasia), i.e., to show how weakness of will is possible?</li> <li>How does Plato's division of the soul into three parts fit into the broader argument of the <em>Republic</em> for the conclusion that justice is an essential component of the happy (human) life? (If it were to turn out that the soul is incomposite, would that undermine the broader argument?)</li> </ul></li> <li>In the <em>Republic</em>, Plato sketches a state employing carefully controlled media, restrictions on private property, with a rigid social hierarchy justified by a &quot;noble lie&quot; (414d-415d). This is in stark contrast to what many of us would regard as the most just state. Explain and evaluate Plato's arguments for thinking that an ideally just state would require such restrictions. (You may choose to focus on either censorship, property, or the &quot;noble lie&quot;, though your discussion should address the broader issues which Plato thinks justifies the whole range of restrictions.) Would his &quot;Republic&quot; promote the happiness of all of its citizens? Do you think that a more democratic state (such as ours) is better equipped to promote the happiness of its citizens? Why or why not?</li> <li>State and explain the premises of the &quot;Third Man Argument&quot;, showing how each premise plays a role in the theory of Forms. Then show how the premises generate an infinite regress. Should Plato take this to be a refutation of his theory of Forms? Are there assumptions underlying the argument which Plato could reject to save his theory? What assumptions of the argument would Aristotle reject, and on what grounds? What response to the argument do you find most reasonable, and why?</li> <li>Aristotle believes that something's nature will enable us to explain its regular behavior, i.e., its characteristic activities and natural changes. In <em>Physics II</em>, Aristotle suggests that some are tempted to think that something's nature is its matter. E.g., he says, <p><em>Some people think that the nature and reality of a thing which is due to nature is the primary constituent present in it, something unformed in itself. Thus in a bed it would be the wood, in a statue the bronze. (193a9-11)</em></p> <p>Although Aristotle is willing to acknowledge that something's nature may include both matter and form (see 199a31-33), he believes that form &quot;has a better claim than the matter&quot; to count as something's nature (see 193b8). Explain Aristotle's reasons for rejecting the proposal that something's matter has the best claim to being its nature, and explain why he thinks that form is a better candidate. Note that in offering your explanation it will be important to explicate Aristotle's doctrine of four causes, and his views on the roles of matter and form in explanation. Do you think Aristotle is right that form has the better claim to being something's nature?</p></li> <li>In discussing the nature of the soul in <em>De Anima II</em>: 1, Aristotle claims: <p><em>Being awake, then, is &lt;a second&gt; actuality, corresponding to cutting or seeing. The soul is &lt;a first&gt; actuality, corresponding to &lt;the faculty of&gt; sight and to the potentiality of the instrument &lt;to cut&gt;; and the body is potentially this...It is clear, then, that the soul is not separable from the body.</em></p> <p>What does Aristotle mean in claiming that the soul is the &quot;first actuality&quot; of the body? On this account, is the soul separable from the body? Why or why not? (It may be useful to compare this account of the soul with the view Plato presents in the <em>Phaedo</em>.) Suppose a materialist is someone who believes that all that exists is material objects and their material properties. Would Aristotle's account of the soul be compatible with materialism? (Note that you may have to clarify for your purposes what you will mean by &quot;material&quot;.)</p></li> </ol> <p>Students may write on a topic of their own if it is approved by the instructor in advance.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Topics for Third Paper</h2> <p>Write a 5-7 page (1500-2100 word) paper on&nbsp;<strong>one</strong> of the following topics. Papers are due 2 days after Lecture 26 (you may email it to me). Be sure that your paper has a clear and comprehensible <strong>thesis</strong>; that it contains <strong>arguments</strong> for that thesis; and that it anticipates and responds to likely <strong>criticisms</strong>. Remember that as an interpreter it is your responsibility to show the author's ideas in their strongest and most plausible form, while remaining true to the text.</p> <p>If you did <em>not</em> write on one of these two topics from the second set of paper topics, you may write on one of them for your third paper:</p> <ol> <li>Aristotle believes that something's nature will enable us to explain its regular behavior, i.e., its characteristic activities and natural changes. In <em>Physics II</em>, Aristotle suggests that some are tempted to think that something's nature is its matter. E.g., he says,<br /> <br /> <em>Some people think that the nature and reality of a thing which is due to nature is the primary constituent present in it, something unformed in itself.

(193a9-11)<br /> <br /> </em>Although Aristotle is willing to acknowledge that something's nature may include both matter and form (see 199a31-33), he believes that form &quot;has a better claim than the matter&quot; to count as something's nature (see 193b8).

Note that in offering your explanation it will be important to explicate Aristotle's doctrine of four causes, and his views on the roles of matter and form in explanation. Do you think Aristotle is right that form has the better claim to being something's nature?</li> <li>In discussing the nature of the soul in <em>De Anima II</em>: 1, Aristotle claims:<br /> <br /> <em>Being awake, then, is &lt;a second&gt; actuality, corresponding to cutting or seeing. The soul is &lt;a first&gt; actuality, corresponding to &lt;the faculty of&gt; sight and to the potentiality of the instrument &lt;to cut&gt;; and the body is potentially this...It is clear, then, that the soul is not separable from the body.<br /> <br /> </em>What does Aristotle mean in claiming that the soul is the &quot;first actuality&quot; of the body? On this account, is the soul separable from the body? Why or why not? (It may be useful to compare this account of the soul with the view Plato presents in the <em>Phaedo</em>.) Suppose a materialist is someone who believes that all that exists is material objects and their material properties. Would Aristotle's account of the soul be compatible with materialism? (Note that you may have to clarify for your purposes what you will mean by &quot;material&quot;.) OR, you may write on one of the following:</li> <li>Like Socrates and Plato before him, Aristotle believes that the happy life is the life of virtue. Aristotle maintains that happiness, i.e., human good, &quot;turns out to be activity of the soul in conformity with excellence, and if there are more than one excellence, in conformity with the best and most complete&quot;. (NE I:7 1098a16-18) What does Aristotle mean by this, and what reasons does he offer for this conclusion? Do you find his reasons convincing? Does it follow from this view that the life of contemplation is the best and most virtuous life for humans?</li> <li>Aristotle clearly believes that one cannot be taught virtue, or excellence, simply through a course of philosophical study. Eg., he says,<br /> <br /> <em>It is well said, then, that it is by doing just acts that the just man is produced, and by doing temperate acts the temperate man; without doing these no one would have even a prospect of becoming good. But most people do not do these, but take refuge in theory and think they are being philosophers and will become good in this way...[but they] will not be made well in soul by such a course of philosophy. (1105b8-18)<br /> <br /> </em>Explicate Aristotle's definition of excellence (see 1106b36-1107a2), explaining why he thinks that one cannot learn to be virtuous simply through philosophical inquiry. On his view, how do we become excellent and virtuous? If philosophical study is not a method for becoming virtuous, why does he write the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>, ie., what is its point? Indicate the strengths and weaknesses of Aristotle's position. (Note that it may be helpful to consider Aristotle's position in light of Socrates' view that philosophy is morally therapeutic.)</li> <li>According to the Epicureans, atoms are: (1) unchangeable and indivisible, (2) eternal, (3) continuously moving, and (4) have shape and weight but no color; moreover, some of them also &quot;swerve&quot; (e.g., <em>On the Nature of the Universe</em>, Bk 2). Present the arguments supporting the attribution of each of these characteristics to the atoms, indicating the strengths and weaknesses of the arguments. Given that the Epicureans believed that experience is the foundation for all knowledge, can they consistently claim that we know that there are atoms (and that they have features (1-4)), even if we don't experience them? Why or why not?</li> <li>Plato in the <em>Phaedo</em> and Lucretius in the <em>On the Nature of the Universe</em>, (Bk 3) each claim that we should not fear death, though they believe this for different reasons.

Demonstrated evidence of copying (exactly the same presentations, same wording of sentences, etc.) will result in zeros for each paper with this

Rather, it is at once a public (urban) act and a reflection of our understanding of the world at any given moment: i.e., what it might be. Its formal order both reflects and promotes plausible ideas of social, philosophical and urban order. Architecture is an art to be sure, but it is a social art, an urban art since we teach what we believe; we design projects not to explore style, but to explore what we consider to be fundamental to architecture: namely, issues of space, urbanism, and meaning. Today, that involves exploring the elusive interface between architecture and urbanism.\" - Michael Dennis, \"Notes on the quarrel between the ancients and the moderns,\" 30 March 2004.</p>\n<p>This studio explores the interface between architecture and urban design through projects focused on the design of housing and public space in Providence, Rhode Island. Providence has undergone a radical transformation from a city with little economic base to a city growing around its vibrant arts and culture community and has for this reason been called the \"Renaissance City\". Despite recent successes, however, Providence has been unable to attract residents to its downtown to any great extent (Downcity), and this lack of a stable residential downtown population has stalled the city's growth.</p>\n<p>Providence's last official plan covered the years 2000-2005. As the end of its scope nears, now is an opportune time to re-examine the city's downtown development in anticipation of the new building cycle and in conjunction with the drafting of the next official plan. We will work with the City of Providence, local housing agencies such as the Providence Neighborhood Housing Corporation, and local community interests and developers to understand the needs and demands for urban housing in downtown Providence. Due to its close proximity to Boston, the studio will travel to Providence on several occasions to talk with participants and to investigate the projects sites.</p>\n<p>The studio will not focus on housing alone, however. Instead, it will operate on the premise that public spaces are important to the livability of a city, especially a city like Providence whose economic base is arts and culture. The public realm quite literally provides the platform for its arts and culture to exist and adds to the desirability of its inhabitants. Housing design is necessary not only to bring people, but also to literally give shape to the public spaces of the city. In this studio, we explore both in the hopes of helping Providence continue its renaissance.</p>"}},{"id":"1cccd93b-52a6-5680-9720-c3b0fca85a6c","trackingTitle":"4.163J - Calendar","title":"Calendar","url":"/courses/architecture/4-163j-urban-design-studio-providence-spring-2005/calendar","shortUrl":"calendar","coursePageType":"CourseSection","text":{"text":"\n<p>As an architecture studio, this course is project based and the schedule reflects various stages of project work broken into smaller segments.

The ability to design one's own distributed system includes an ability to argue for one's design choices.</p> <p>This primary objective is supported by a few others:</p> <ul>     <li>The students will be able to evaluate and critique existing systems, as well as their own system designs. As part of that, students will learn to recognize design choices made in existing systems.</li>     <li>The students will be able to apply the technical material taught in lecture to new system components. This implies an ability to recognize and describe:     <ul>         <li>How common design patterns in computer system&mdash;such as abstraction and modularity&mdash;are used to limit complexity.</li>         <li>How operating systems use virtualization and abstraction to enforce modularity.</li>         <li>How the Internet is designed to deal with scale, a diversity of applications, and competing economic interests.</li>         <li>How reliable, usable distributed systems are able to be built on top of an unreliable network.</li>         <li>Common pitfalls in the security of computer systems, and how to combat them.</li>     </ul></li> </ul> <p>Because this is a <a href=\"https://registrar.mit.edu/registration-academics/academic-requirements/communication-requirement/ci-m-subjects\">Communication Intensive in the Major</a> (CI-M) class, students will also learn to communicate in forms that are common in the field of computer systems. This includes written design reports, oral presentations, and peer review.</p> <p>The communication instruction also supports the primary learning objective of designing systems. In the real world, we design systems in teams, and communication of many forms (written, oral, etc.) is part of that process.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Required Text</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0123749573/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" border=\"0\" align=\"absmiddle\" /></a> Saltzer, Jerome H. and M.

[Preview with <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=I-NOcVMGWSUC&amp;pg=PAfrontcover\">Google Books</a>]</p> <p>The text supplements the lectures and recitations; it should be your first resource when you are confused by a lecture topic, or want more information.</p> <p><a href=\"./resolveuid/c6b38c8ecf9c7599c9c88414f33b91f4\">Part II of the textbook</a> is available on MIT OpenCourseWare.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Structure</h2> <p>The course has three components: lectures, recitations, and tutorials. We expect you to attend all three, as they each serve a different purpose.</p> <ol>     <li><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Lectures</h3></li>     <p>Lectures are held on Mondays and Wednesdays for one hour. The lectures are designed to teach students the technical details necessary to design their own systems and to put those details in larger contexts: both the contexts of a specific area of systems as well as systems in general.</p>     <p>This type of material appears in lectures because that's what lectures are good at: giving a higher-level context for the details of the class.</p>     <li><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Recitations</h3></li>     <p>Recitations are held on Tuesdays and Thursdays for one hour. For the first recitation, attend whichever one you want. After that, you will be assigned a permanent section.</p>     <p>Recitations are designed to give students a chance to practice their system-analysis and oral communication skills. Each recitation revolves around a particular paper in systems. Through reading these papers, students get a better sense of how communication in the field is done. Recitations are discussion-based; students get practice analyzing, critiquing, and communicating about systems.</p>     <li><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Writing Tutorials</h3></li>     <p>Writing tutorials are held on Fridays for one hour. We will assign you timeslot during the first week of classes.</p>     <p>Most of these tutorials will teach the communication theory and practices of this course and assist you in preparing for the assignments. You'll become fluent in a variety of communication genres, develop strategies and skills needed to present technical concepts to different audiences, learn how to use writing to develop and deepen your technical understanding&mdash;and get specific, directed instruction on writing and presenting your assignments. A handful of the tutorials will be dedicated to discussing the design project.</p> </ol> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Late Policy</h2> <p>You must hand in assignments when they are due, and you must attend quizzes at the scheduled times. If you feel you have a compelling reason for not handing in an assignment on time, or for not attending a quiz, please talk to Dr. LaCurts in advance.</p> <p>The only exception to this late policy is design project materials. For those, the late policy will be explicitly posted on each assignment.</p> <p>If you miss an assignment deadline, you should still hand in the assignment; we'll give you feedback even though we won't give you credit for your final grade. Furthermore, doing assignments is the best way to prepare for exams and design project. Unless otherwise specified, assignments are due at 5:00pm on their assigned due-date.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grade Components</h2> <p>Each assignment supports the objectives of the class in various ways.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Technical Material (35% of Grade)</h3> <ul>     <li>Quizzes: One quiz is held during the term. A second quiz will be scheduled during finals week. Each quiz will focus on half of the class material, but keep in mind that later topics build heavily upon the earlier topics. The quizzes will test material from lectures, recitations, and the assigned reading and let us test whether students have mastered the technical material.</li>     <li>Hands-ons: During most weeks, you will be expected to complete a hands-on experiment that requires a computer. These reinforce some of the abstract concepts from the lectures or papers that week and let you find out how things really work. (Note: Hands-on experiments are not available to OCW users.)</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Communication + System Design and Analysis (40% of Grade)</h3> <p>The staff has worked with the MIT Writing, Rhetoric, and Professional Communication (WRAP) program for more than 10 years to design the writing and speaking assignments. We have chosen assignments that are similar to the kinds of writing you will do in the engineering workplace: Preliminary reports, final reports, and presentations. Communication assignments are designed to help you conceptualize and develop the design project.</p> <ul>     <li>Design Project: The primary assignment in 6.033 is the design project (DP). This project is where the students get to design their own system, which is the primary objective of this course.</li>     <p>The DP requires you to develop a detailed system design to solve a real-world problem. This project will extend over most of the semester, and will be done in teams of three students, all of whom attend the same writing tutorial (with exceptions only for extenuating circumstances). Real-world systems are not built individually; it's always a team effort. Part of the DP is to learn to work productively and effectively in this setting. We will give you tools for doing so in the writing tutorials.</p>     <p>The DP consists of multiple deliverables: a preliminary report, oral presentation, final report, and peer review. The <a href=\"./resolveuid/7359417784bd559facb2aadc9d04abe7\">Design Project</a> page gives more detail about the DP deliverables.</p>     <li>System Critiques: One of the goals of this class is for students to be able to analyze and critique technical systems. We will assign multiple system critiques during the semester.</li>     <p>These critiques will be graded by your Teaching Assistants (TAs) and/or Communication Instructors and assigned a letter grade (we will specify more details about grading in each of the assignments). The expectations for each individual critique will be detailed in the tutorials. As your skills at analyzing and reading technical papers improve throughout the semester, we will expect your critiques to reflect that.</p> </ul> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Participation (25% of Grade)</h3> <ul>     <li>Recitation Participation: Our recitations are discussion-based, and we expect you to be engaged and participate. Participating in a recitation means:     <ul>         <li>Coming prepared to recitation (doing the reading, turning in the pre-reading question etc.)</li>         <li>Paying attention when the instructor is speaking (you can't participation in a discussion if you don't know what it's about)</li>         <li>Participating (verbally) in pair-/group-work</li>         <li>Volunteering to answer questions when the instructor asks them. (Note that you may not get called on each time. That's okay; our class sizes prevent that. Statistically, if you're raising your hand frequently, you'll get called on with some frequency.)</li>         <li>Responding to other student's comments with an opinion of their own.</li>         <li>Asking good questions in recitation (where &quot;good&quot; just means it's clear that you prepared for the recitation).</li>     </ul></li>     <p>We will assign the participation grade in two parts: one for the first half of the semester, one for the second half of the semester. We will also give you preliminary grades for each of these (one about a quarter into the semester, one about three quarters into the semester), so that you know where you stand and have time to improve. This document explains in more detail how your participation grade is determined.</p>     <p>Communication Participation: A portion of your participation grade will also be based on your participation in writing tutorials and on your understanding of communication concepts and skills, as demonstrated by your work on the design project and evaluated by your communication instructor.</p> </ul> <p>Note that over a third of your grade comes from written assignments; we expect you to take writing seriously in this class.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>The class consists of three components: technical material, communication/system design and analysis, and participation. Each of these components comprises roughly one third of your grade, according to the following breakdown:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table class=\"tablewidth75\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\">     <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading table.</caption>  <!-- BEGIN TABLE HEADER (for MIT OCW Table Template 2.51) -->     <thead>         <tr>             <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th>             <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th>         </tr>     </thead>     <!-- END TABLE HEADER -->     <tbody>         <tr class=\"row\">             <td><p><em>Technical Material</em></p>             <p>30% for Quizzes (two @ 15% each)</p>             <p>5% for Hands-Ons</p></td>             <td>35%</td>         </tr>         <tr class=\"alt-row\">             <td><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Communication + System Design and Analysis</h3>             <p>10% for Design Project (DP) Preliminary Report and Presentation</p>             <p>20% for DP report</p>             <p>4% for DP Peer Review</p>             <p>6% for Critiques (Critique #1 =2%, Critique #2 = 4%)</p></td>             <td>40%</td>         </tr>         <tr class=\"row\">             <td><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Participation</h3>             <p>20% for Recitation Participation</p>             <p>5% for Communication Participation</p></td>             <td>25%</td>         </tr>     </tbody> </table></div> <p>You must complete all design project assignments in order to pass 6.033. If you do not, you will automatically receive an F.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Collaboration Policy</h2> <p>You may not collaborate on quizzes. On hands-ons, it's okay to discuss ideas with your classmates, but you should not be collaborating on the actual answers. Take the UNIX hands-on for example: it's okay to talk to your classmates about what pipes are, it's not okay to work together to come up with a command that gives a long listing of the smallest given files in the /etc directory whose name contains the string &quot;.conf&quot;, sorted by increasing file size (i.e., the solution to one of the first questions).</p> <p>On all writing assignments you are welcome to discuss ideas with others, but your writing should be your own and you should acknowledge all contributions of ideas by others, whether from classmates or from papers you have read.</p>"}},{"id":"41b4891e-e2fe-518b-bfee-e88bd0b5a140","trackingTitle":"6.033 - Calendar","title":"Calendar","url":"/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-033-computer-system-engineering-spring-2018/calendar","shortUrl":"calendar","coursePageType":"CourseSection","text":{"text":"<p>The course has three major components: Lectures, Recitations, and Tutorials.

It's from 2002, but the concepts still apply today.</p>\r\n<p>If you are confused by any part of the DARPA paper, especially terminology, those two guides should be your first resources.</p>\r\n<p>A bit of background on the paper itself:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>This paper was written in 1988, before the Internet was commercialized. (Prior to commercialization, the NSF controlled most of the Internet primary routes that make up the Internet. In the early nineties, they sold their assets, which allowed private corporations to gain control. As a result&mdash;of this, and of a few other things&mdash;it became easier to do business on the Internet.)</li>\r\n    <li>The paper makes occasional reference to &quot;TCP.&quot; We will learn the details of TCP in a future lecture. For now, you only need to know that TCP provides <i>reliable transport</i>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The paper starts by introducing the goals of the Internet's architecture (Sections 1&ndash;3).

I.e., advertisements are flooded.</li>         <li>After flooding, each node should have a complete map of the network (except in the case of very specific, very rare sequences of advertisement loss).

Initially, W is all  nodes in the network.</li>             <li>We also keep track of the current costs and routes to all of the nodes. Initially:             <p>routing_table [self] = Self; routing_table [anyone else] = ?<br />             cost_table [self] = 0; cost_table [anyone else] = infinity</p></li>             <p>While W is not empty:</p>             <ul type=\"1\">                 <li>u = the node in W we have the minimum cost to so far</li>                 <li>Remove u from W</li>                 <li>For every neighbor v of u:<br />                 <code>d = cost_table [u] + cost (u, v)<br />                 if d &lt; cost_table [v]<br />                 &nbsp; cost_table [v] = d<br />                 &nbsp; routing_table [v] = routing_table [u]</code></li>             </ul>         </ul></li>     </ul>     <ul>         <li>Good things: Flooding makes link-state extremely robust to failure.

This paper was written in 1988. In 1988, routing algorithms such as link-state and distance-vector (which you'll see in the preceding lecture) already existed. The Internet also existed, and was beginning to grow, but was not the network it is today.</p> <p>To help you as you read:</p> <ul>     <li>Section 2.1 gives an overview of <i>Area Hierarchy</i>, an existing system. The paper will continue to contrast landmark routing with area hierarchy.</li>     <li>Section 2.2 gives an overview of <i>Landmark Hierarchy</i>, the system that this paper is proposing. You should understand how routing and addressing work in this system. A good quick check is to look at Figure 4 and figure out what entries should be in Router g's table (the text below Figure 4 will tell you the answer).</li>     <li>Section 3 gives a very brief overview of some of the other algorithms required for landmark routing.</li>     <li>Section 4 presents results on the performance of the landmark hierarchy, often in contrast to the area hierarchy. While reading this section, you should think about what aspects of their analysis are convincing (if any) and what aspects are not (if any).</li> </ul> <p>As you read, think about the following:</p> <ul>     <li>How does the landmark hierarchy differ from the area hierarchy? Are there places where they perform similarly, or make similar tradeoffs?</li>     <li>The landmark hierarchy was not used on the Internet.

Look different depending on which neighbor.         <ul>             <li>BGP runs on top of TCP, a reliable-transport protocol. Doesn't have to do periodic advertisements to handle failure. Instead, push advs when routes change.</li>         </ul></li>         <li>Integration: Via policies described above.</li>         <li>Failures: Routes can be explicitly withdrawn in BGP when they fail.

Arpaci-Dusseau</p> <p>The Log-Structured File System departs dramatically from the UNIX  File System and proposes, instead, a file system in which all of the  data is stored in <i>an append-only log</i>, that is, a flat file  that can be modified only by having data added to the end of it.  In  Chapter 9, we also hear about logs, specifically how they help  achieve <i>reliability</i>. For today's reading, the purpose of the  log is to achieve good <i>performance</i>.</p> <p>The primary goal of a log-structured file system is to minimize     seeks by treating the disk as an infinite append-only log. For     example, the file system software simply appends new files to the     end of the log.</p> <p>As you read, think about the following:</p> <ul>     <li>The &quot;infinite log&quot; is actually on a finite disk; how does that   constraint affect the designers' goals?</li>     <li>Are there certain file access patterns by applications might make   it hard for a log-structured file system to avoid seeks?</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Questions for Recitation</h2> <p><b>Before you come to this recitation</b>, write up (on paper) a <i>brief</i> answer to the following (really&mdash;we don't need more than a couple sentences for each question).&nbsp;</p> <p>Your answers to these questions should be <b>in your own \twords</b>, not direct quotations from the paper.</p> <ul>     <li>What is one technique that the log-structure filesystem uses to   achieve higher performance?  <i>(There is more than one technique.)</i></li>     <li>How does the log-structured file system implement this technique?</li>     <li>Why does this technique, along with minimizing seeks, lead to good performance?</li> </ul> <p>As always, there are multiple correct answers for each of these questions.</p>"}},{"id":"00b4994c-2830-55e5-bfd0-0654f6b71b01","trackingTitle":"6.033 - Lecture 17 Outline","title":"Lecture 17 Outline","url":"/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-033-computer-system-engineering-spring-2018/week-9/lecture-17-outline","shortUrl":"lecture-17-outline","coursePageType":"CourseSection","text":{"text":"<ol>     <li>Introduction     <ul>         <li>Last time: Atomicity via logging.

I am using &quot;coordinator&quot; because we're coming from the world of 2PC: Clients (users) send request to the coordinators, and those coordinators deal with the internals of the system (contacting appropriate servers, etc.). I want you to understand how this whole picture fits together.</p> <p>But a lot of times we use &quot;client&quot; as a generic term in the client/server setup. So in reading about RSMs, when you see client,it's just the part of the system sending requests to the servers for data. In the context of 2PC, the client in an RSM is the coordinator from 2PC.</p>"}},{"id":"3e8ba609-6abb-52b3-94c5-d719b12c8fc6","trackingTitle":"6.033 - Raft Assignment","title":"Raft Assignment","url":"/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-033-computer-system-engineering-spring-2018/week-11/raft-assignment","shortUrl":"raft-assignment","coursePageType":"CourseSection","text":{"text":"<p>For this recitation, you'll be \treading &quot;<img src=\"/images/inacessible.gif\" alt=\"This resource may not render correctly in a screen reader.\" /><a href=\"https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf\">In Search of an \tUnderstandable Consensus Algorithm (PDF)</a>&quot; by Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout.

Instead of having a centralized bank keep track of all transactions, we'll let everybody* keep track of all transactions.         <ul>             <li>Need a way to secure the log, and to make sure everyone has the correct version of the log.</li>         </ul></li>         <li>Sketch of this idea:<ul>             <li>If Alice sends a coin to Bob, he publishes that transaction and alerts everyone.</li>             <li>If Alice later tries to send the same coin to Charlie, all parties in the network will know that something is amiss: They'll see that Alice already sent that coin to Bob.</li>         </ul></li>         <li>Problem: What if Alice sent the coin to Bob and Charlie at the time, effectively spending it with both parties before either has had a chance to publish the transaction.</li>         <li>One idea: Get consensus. Agreement from &quot;enough people&quot; as to which transaction is valid (either the one with Bob or the one with Charlie).</li>         <li>Instead of &quot;enough people&quot;, let's say, specifically, &quot;more than 50% of the network&quot;. There are at least two problems with this:         <ol type=\"1\">             <li>We might not know how many people are in the network.</li>             <li>Even if we know how many people are in the network, Alice could create multiple identities herself. This is known as a Sybil Attack: A user subverts a system by creating multiple identities.</li>         </ol></li>     </ul></li>     <li>Proofs-of-work     <ul>         <li>Proofs-of-work thwart Sybil Attacks. Make it computationally expensive to perform an action. Then, multiple identities don't help. You need a lot of computational power to perform a Sybil Attack, which is much harder to get.</li>         <li>Bitcoin's proof of work:         <ul>             <li>A user K broadcasts the following message to users on the network: &quot;I, K, want to spend coin 198601 with Bob.&quot;</li>             <li>Users who hear that message add it to their queue of pending transactions. Their goal is to verify a block of those transactions.</li>             <li>After a user checks that the block is valid - that everyone owns the coins they're trying to spend&mdash;they set about solving the following &quot;puzzle&quot;:             <ul type=\"i\">                 <li>t = block of transactions (as a bitstring).</li>                 <li>Find x such that H(t|x) &lt; target.</li>                 <li>Target changes frequently. Adjusted so that it takes roughly ten minutes to solve this puzzle.</li>             </ul></li>             <li>When a user solves the puzzle (finds x), they broadcast the block out along with x. They receive a monetary reward for solving the proof of work, to motivate users to take part in this process.</li>             <li>This process is known as &quot;mining&quot; bitcoins.</li>         </ul></li>         <li>What if two people solve the puzzle at the same time? We'll save that problem for a second.</li>     </ul></li>     <li>Ordering Transactions     <ul>         <li>How does validating with the log work?</li>         <li>Log contains verified transaction blocks *and* a pointer to the previous block. This provides an ordering on the transactions, so we know who owns what coin.         <ul>             <li>The &quot;pointer&quot; is a hash of the previous block.</li>             <li>The log is actually called the blockchain.</li>         </ul></li>         <li>If two people solve the puzzle at the same time, the blockchain forks:</li>         <p><img src=\"./resolveuid/d3601a92393bb430c3f522cb995c18f8\" alt=\"Diagram of a blockchain fork.\" width=\"300\" height=\"71\" /></p>         <li>When a fork occurs, miners keep track of both forks and work to extend the longest fork. Pretty quickly, the shorter fork is rendered invalid.</li>         <li>Formally: A transaction is not confirmed until it is part of a block on the longest fork and at least five blocks follow it in the longest fork.</li>     </ul></li>     <li>Did We Prevent Double-spending?     <ul>         <li>Can Alice validate a block that includes a transaction with the same coin at two different people? No, the rest of the network will see something is amiss when they get that block.</li>         <li>Can Alice try to spend the same coin twice with Bob and Charlie and get the network to verify it? No. At best, the blockchain will fork, but eventually only one fork (and so one transaction) will be validated.</li>         <li>Can Alice spend the same coin with Charlie and herself (as a Sybil)? Send the coin to Charlie, wait for the transaction to be entirely confirmed, then have her Sybil fork the chain prior to the transaction with Charlie, and &quot;catch up&quot; with the system so that the new branch becomes longer? (Effectively invalidating the previous transaction, but Alice already spent that coin.) Unlikely&mdash;other miners won't help, so she'd need a lot of compute power.</li>     </ul></li>     <li>Discussion     <ul>         <li>Bitcoin provides you with a distributed public ledger. You can build other things on top of that, not just a digital currency.</li>         <li>Possible criticisms:         <ul>             <li>Proofs-of-work waste computation.</li>             <li>In practice, users are either &quot;normal&quot; users who spend but don't mine, or mining pools who mine but don't spend.</li>             <li>It can take a long time to confirm a transaction.</li>         </ul></li>         <li>Alternatives exist for solving some of these problems.<ul>             <li>Ethereum and Algorand are two.</li>         </ul></li>         <li>Are users actually anonymous?</li>     </ul></li> </ol> <p>&nbsp;</p>"}},{"id":"e3cf08ab-2985-5c83-ab7f-b92cff0bad4f","trackingTitle":"6.033 - Memory Corruption Assignment","title":"Memory Corruption Assignment","url":"/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-033-computer-system-engineering-spring-2018/week-13/memory-corruption-assignment","shortUrl":"memory-corruption-assignment","coursePageType":"CourseSection","text":{"text":"<p>For this recitation, you'll be reading <img alt=\"This resource may not render correctly in a screen reader.\" src=\"/images/inacessible.gif\" />&quot;<a href=\"https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/papers/Oakland13-SoK-CR.pdf\">SoK: Eternal War in Memory (PDF)</a>&quot; by Lazlo Szekeres, Mathia Payer, Tao Wei, and Dawn Song.

One way to avoid treacherous     software would be to write all your software yourself. Although     this approach would in principle solve the problem, it is     overwhelmingly impractical.

This project is where the students get to design their own system, which is the primary objective of this course.</p>\r\n<p>The design project requires you to develop a detailed system design to solve a real-world problem. This project will extend over most of the semester and will be done in teams of three students, all of whom attend the same writing tutorial (with exceptions for extenuating circumstances). The project will involve a preliminary report, an oral presentation, an extended final report, and a peer review. The feedback we give on your preliminary report and presentation will aid in writing your final report.</p>\r\n<p>Your design project will be done in teams of three. Real-world systems are not built individually; it's always a team effort. Part of the design project assignment is to learn to work productively and effectively in this setting. We will give you tools for doing so in the writing tutorials.</p>\r\n<p>The <b>Preliminary Report</b> for the design project will be evaluated by your Recitation Instructor and your Tutorial Instructor. Your Tutorial Instructor will evaluate it according to the grading rubric and assign a letter grade. Your Recitation Instructor will evaluate the preliminary report to make sure your design is on the right track; you should incorporate their feedback into the presentation and report.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The <b>Presentation</b> will be graded by your Recitation Instructor. Your presentation should reflect the feedback you got on your preliminary report; feedback on your presentation should inform your final report. We will release guidelines for the presentation as the due date gets nearer, but in general, your presentation will focus on any changes you have made since the preliminary report, rather than re-capping the entire system.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The presentation will receive a grade of check, check+, or check-. A check+ will move your preliminary report grade up one letter, a check- will move it down one letter, and a check will not change it. (E.g., if you receive a B on the preliminary report, and a check+ on the presentation, your &quot;preliminary report + presentation&quot; grade is an A.) Together with your preliminary report, this will be worth 10% of your final grade.</p>\r\n<p>The <b>Final Report</b> will also be graded by your Recitation Instructor and will receive a letter grade. This will be worth 20% of your final grade.</p>\r\n<p>The <b>Peer Review</b> will be graded by your Tutorial Instructor and Teaching Assistant and will receive a letter grade. This will be worth 4% of your final grade.</p>\r\n<h2 class=\"subhead\"><a name=\"deliverables\"></a>Deliverables</h2>\r\n<p>Below are all DP deliverables and related material.

The faculty may alter grades to reflect class participation, improvement, effort and other qualitative measures of performance.</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table summary=\"See table caption for summary.\" class=\"tablewidth50\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading table.</caption> <thead> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Problem Sets</td> <td>30%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Midterm Exam</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Term Paper</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Final Exam</td> <td>35%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p>&nbsp;</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Problem Sets</h2> <p>Problem sets are a very important part of 8.06. We believe that sitting down yourself and trying to reason your way through a problem not only helps you learn the material deeply, but also develops analytical tools fundamental to a successful career in science. We recognize that students also learn a great deal from talking to and working with each other. We therefore encourage each 8.06 student to make his/her own attempt on every problem and then, having done so, to discuss the problems with one another and collaborate on understanding them more fully. The solutions you submit must reflect your own work. They must not be transcriptions or reproductions of other people's work. Plagiarism is a serious offense and is easy to recognize. Don't submit work which is not your own.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Term Paper</h2> <p>Everyone in 8.06 will be expected to research, write and &quot;publish&quot; a short paper on a topic related to the content of 8.05 or 8.06. The paper can explain a physical effect or further explicate ideas or problems covered in the courses. It can be based on the student's own calculations and/or library research. The paper should be written in the style and format of a brief journal article and should aim at an audience of 8.06 students. Writing, editing, revising and &quot;publishing&quot; skills are an integral part of the project, which is described in full in the <a href=\"/courses/physics/8-06-quantum-physics-iii-spring-2005/projects\">projects</a> section.</p> <p>Because 8.06 is a CI-M (<a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/commreq/background.html\">Communication Intensive in the Major</a>) Subject, in order to pass 8.06 you must obtain a grade of C or better on your term paper. If you do not succeed in this, you will get a grade of Incomplete until you revise your term paper sufficiently to earn at least a C, and only at that time you will be assigned a final grade based on the breakdown given above.</p>"}},{"id":"a01ad7da-ef3e-523d-beae-a1e857c530f1","trackingTitle":"8.06 - Calendar","title":"Calendar","url":"/courses/physics/8-06-quantum-physics-iii-spring-2005/calendar","shortUrl":"calendar","coursePageType":"CourseSection","text":{"text":"\n<div class=\"maintabletemplate\">\n<table class=\"tablewidth75\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\">\n<caption class=\"invisible\">Calendar table.</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"tbl455id0_0\" scope=\"col\">LEC&nbsp;#</th>\n<th id=\"tbl455id0_1\" scope=\"col\">TOPICS</th>\n<th id=\"tbl455id0_2\" scope=\"col\">RELATED&nbsp;ASSIGNMENTS</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"row\">\n<td headers=\"tbl455id0_0\">1</td>\n<td headers=\"tbl455id0_1\">Natural Units</td>\n<td headers=\"tbl455id0_2\">Assignment 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"alt-row\">\n<td headers=\"tbl455id0_0\">2-4</td>\n<td headers=\"tbl455id0_1\">Degenerate Fermi Systems</td>\n<td headers=\"tbl455id0_2\">Assignment 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row\">\n<td headers=\"tbl455id0_0\">4-8</td>\n<td headers=\"tbl455id0_1\">Charged Particles in a Magnetic Field</td>\n<td headers=\"tbl455id0_2\">Assignments 2, 3, 4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"alt-row\">\n<td headers=\"tbl455id0_0\">9-12</td>\n<td headers=\"tbl455id0_1\">Time-independent Perturbation Theory</td>\n<td headers=\"tbl455id0_2\">Assignments&nbsp;4, 5, 6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row\">\n<td headers=\"tbl455id0_0\">13-15</td>\n<td headers=\"tbl455id0_1\">Variational and Semi-classical Methods</td>\n<td headers=\"tbl455id0_2\">Assignments 7, 8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"alt-row\">\n<td headers=\"tbl455id0_0\">16-18</td>\n<td headers=\"tbl455id0_1\">The Adiabatic Approximation and Berry's Phase</td>\n<td headers=\"tbl455id0_2\">Assignment 8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row\">\n<td headers=\"tbl455id0_0\">19-23</td>\n<td headers=\"tbl455id0_1\">Scattering</td>\n<td headers=\"tbl455id0_2\">Assignments 9, 10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"alt-row\">\n<td headers=\"tbl455id0_0\">23-24</td>\n<td headers=\"tbl455id0_1\">Time-dependent Perturbation Theory</td>\n<td headers=\"tbl455id0_2\">Optional Problem Set</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row\">\n<td headers=\"tbl455id0_0\">25</td>\n<td headers=\"tbl455id0_1\">Quantum Computing</td>\n<td headers=\"tbl455id0_2\">Optional Problem Set</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"}},{"id":"44551e8f-8428-540a-a742-cfd59d620650","trackingTitle":"8.06 - Readings","title":"Readings","url":"/courses/physics/8-06-quantum-physics-iii-spring-2005/readings","shortUrl":"readings","coursePageType":"CourseSection","text":{"text":"\n<h2 class=\"subhead\">Texts</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0131118927/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img border=\"0\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" align=\"absMiddle\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" /></a> Griffiths, David J. <em>Introduction to Quantum Mechanics</em>. 2nd ed.

The paper can explain a physical effect or further explicate ideas or problems covered in the courses. It can be based on the student's own calculations and/or library research. The paper should be written in the style and format of a brief journal article and should aim at an audience of 8.06 students.</p> <p>Writing, editing, revising and &quot;publishing&quot; skills are an integral part of the project. Each of you will ask another student to edit your draft and will then prepare a final draft on the basis of the suggestions of your &quot;peer editor&quot;. We will supply templates for the Revtex version of LaTeX (used by the <em>Physical Review</em>) so that you can prepare your paper in a finished, publishable form. We will also arrange a LaTeX tutorial, likely in place of sections one day in April.</p> <p>You will submit your first draft marked up with editorial comments by your peer editor. This first draft will then be critiqued by a &quot;writing assistant&quot; (see below) and returned to you. Two weeks after the first draft is due, you will submit your final draft. Your papers will be graded on the intellectual quality of your work, the effectiveness of your presentation and the success of your prose style. A part of your grade will also be determined by how carefully and constructively you edited the draft of the paper for which you were the peer editor. The grade you earn for your paper will count 20% towards your final grade in 8.06.</p> <p>Because 8.06 is a CI-M (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://web.mit.edu/commreq/background.html\">Communication Intensive in the Major</a>) Subject, in order to pass 8.06 you must obtain a grade of C or better on your term paper. If you do not succeed in this, you will get a grade of Incomplete until you revise your term paper sufficiently to earn at least a C, and only at that time you will be assigned a final grade, with your term paper grade counting 20%.</p> <p>When a practicing physicist writes a research paper, he or she often asks a few colleagues to comment on a first draft. The final draft is then reviewed anonymously by one or several peers before it is accepted by a journal like the <em>Physical Review</em>. The goal of this informal and formal peer review process is to push authors to write papers which successfully communicate ideas among a community of peers. Your goal is to write a paper which presents a phenomenon or problem in quantum physics in a way which communicates your ideas clearly and effectively to your fellow 8.06 students, namely to <em>your</em> peers. Do <em>not</em> seek to teach Profs. Liu and Rajagopal, although they are always happy to learn. <em>Do</em> seek to teach your peers. If your peers cannot understand what you write, you have not succeeded. Note that writing for your peers is a much higher standard than writing for the faculty. Presenting a topic sufficiently clearly and logically that one of your peers new to this topic can learn about it requires clarity of thought and depth of understanding. These are the prerequisites for an effective written (or, for that matter, verbal) presentation.</p> <p>We have obtained resources to support four &quot;writing assistants&quot; who can help you with writing, editing and preparing the paper. Each of you will be contacted by email by one of the writing assistants on March 29. (See the schedule below.) You should arrange to meet soon thereafter, and should seek their assistance from then on as you need it. They will critique the proposal and outline for your paper, and will also critique the first draft which you submit after it has been peer edited. In between, you may also ask them to help you with parts of your paper as you write them. Think of your writing assistant as a coach. They are there to help you, and are good at it. If you wish to get their help earlier than March 29, please submit your paper proposal and the name of your peer editor earlier, and one of the writing assistants will be assigned to help you.</p> <p>By the time you turn in your final paper, it will have been edited by one of your peers and you will also have had time to implement the suggestions of one of the writing assistants. Past 8.06 students have found that their papers improve enormously through this process. Based on experience from previous years, by the time you turn in your finished paper, very many of you will have produced an account of a piece of physics written to a very high standard. It would be a shame if these papers were not &quot;published&quot;. We shall have as our goal the &quot;publication&quot; of a journal consisting of all your papers. There are two important caveats: (i) only papers which are submitted electronically, using the LaTeX template provided, will be published; (ii) only papers which earn a grade of B or higher will be published. Subject to these caveats, we hope to produce a compilation of all of your papers. We will circulate this &quot;journal&quot; to all of you, so that you can in the end read the work of all your peers, and not just of the one person whose work you edited.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">2) Schedule and Due Dates for the Paper</h2> <p>You should use the first part of the term to consider possible topics and to choose a peer editor. Your peer editor must be an 8.06 student, and must be someone whose own 8.06 paper topic is unrelated to yours. A list of suggested topics is given below, but you are free to choose topics not on this list upon first obtaining Prof. Rajagopal's approval. By the time Spring Break is upon us, you should have a good idea of what you are going to write about and should be well into the process of reading about your topic and doing the calculations, if any are involved. You should spend Spring Break completing your understanding of the physics that you plan to write about, completing any calculations that you plan, and outlining your paper. You will then be ready to write your proposal:</p> <p>Your <strong>proposal</strong> is due on Tuesday March 29, in lecture. This must consist of: a title, a one paragraph description of what you plan to write about, an outline of your proposed paper, a list of several references you plan to use, the name of your peer editor, and your name and email address.</p> <p>You will then be contacted by one of the writing assistants. They may either accept your proposal, or request that you revise it in response to their suggestions. You should arrange to meet with them as soon as possible (even if they accept your proposal). Anyone who has not met with their writing assistant at least once before submitting their first draft will be penalized.</p> <p>Your <strong>peer edited first draft</strong> is due on Tuesday April 12 in lecture. This means that you must give your first draft to your peer editor several days earlier, to give that person sufficient time to critique it substantively by April 12. Each of you should then meet with your writing assistant by Friday April 15 in order to obtain their comments on your first draft. In fact, if A edits for B and B edits for A, I will make sure that A and B have the same writing assistant and would therefore suggest that you both meet him or her together, to obtain comments on both your papers simultaneously. You will get your first drafts back when you meet with your writing assistant.</p> <p>A hard copy of your final, polished paper is due in lecture on Tuesday April 26. Think of this as submitting your paper to The 8.06 <em>Physical Review</em>. If you get back a positive report (i.e. grade of B or better) from the editor (Prof. Rajagopal) you will then be expected to submit your paper for publication electronically. You will all get a copy of the 2005 <em>Physical Review</em>.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">3) Nature of the Paper</h2> <p>The aim of this project is to give a clear and pedagogical presentation of a &quot;problem&quot; or &quot;phenomenon&quot; in quantum mechanics.</p> <ul> <li>A &quot;problem&quot; could be similar to but more elaborate than the type of problems that appear on problem sets. For example, <em>coherent states</em> were introduced briefly in the context of the harmonic oscillator in 8.05. A student might delve deeper into the coherent state formalism, describe the properties of coherent states, explain the types of problems where they are useful, and give some examples of their applications. Such a paper would resemble a short chapter in some hypothetical text book for 8.05. The principal references for a paper like this could be existing quantum mechanics texts and the references to the original literature to be found in them.</li> <li>A paper focused on a &quot;phenomenon&quot; would introduce the phenonomenon and explain its origins in terms of the concepts and language of 8.06. For example, when we treated systems of identical particles at the end of 8.05 we alluded very briefly to the &quot;allotropic forms of hydrogen&quot; known as <em>ortho</em> and <em>para</em> hydrogen. A student might find out what they are, how their properties are understood in terms of Fermi-Dirac statistics, and describe the interesting role they played in the early history of quantum mechanics. Once again the principal references would likely be texts, perhaps modern physics texts in this case, histories of quantum physics, and the original literature.</li> </ul> <p>Papers on &quot;problems&quot; might be based at least in part on your own calculations. Papers on &quot;phenomena&quot; might involve some library research. In either case reference must be given for any material taken from other sources. Do not plagiarize. Anyone who contemplates borrowing material directly from mainstream texts should consider how difficult it is to find a text that presents quantum physics at the level appropriate to 8.06.</p> <p>We encourage students to write papers which expand upon a problem or phenomenon which was already introduced in either 8.05 or 8.06 lectures. If you do this, you should begin at the level of whatever we have already covered and then go farther. Students may also choose topics which have not appeared at all in class, but whose quantum mechanical explanation can be understood based upon what we have learned in 8.05 and 8.06.</p> <p>Please do not try to choose subjects which are obscure, difficult or controversial. Misguided attempts like this to gain the respect of the faculty inevitably have the opposite effect. There are plenty of deep, interesting and challenging subjects in the mainstream of quantum mechanics.</p> <p>Papers can range between 8 - 15 pages (in the LaTeX template provided) in length. These limits are firm.</p> <p>Students are encouraged to use equations and figures to aid their presentation, much as they are used in articles and sophisticated textbooks.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">4) Possible Topics</h2> <p>Students are welcome to suggest topics of their own. You should do this by sending Prof. Rajagopal a brief paragraph by email, summarizing the topic. There is no separate deadline by which you must do this, but note that your complete proposal is due on March 29. At the time you submit your proposal, you should already know that Prof. Rajagopal has approved your choice of topic. (Note that your writing assistant may nevertheless require you to revise your proposal.)</p> <p>Here is a list of possible topics. In some cases, either Prof. Liu or Prof. Rajagopal will have ideas for where to begin reading about these topics. Not in all cases, however.</p> <ol> <li>Coherent states.</li> <li>The allotropic forms of hydrogen.</li> <li>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. For example, you might take off from where we stopped in 8.05 and explain how NMR is applied in a particular experimental context.</li> <li>Magnetic monopoles, gauge invariance, and the Dirac quantization condition for the magnetic charge of a magnetic monopole.</li> <li>Scattering off a magnetic flux tube.</li> <li>Bell's theorem - can classical mechanics imitate quantum mechanics?</li> <li>Neutrino oscillations in vacuum, beyond what we covered in 8.05.</li> <li>Oscillation phenomena involving kaons and/or B mesons, beyond what we covered in 8.05.</li> <li>The solar neutrino problem.</li> <li>Levinson's theorem - how the scattering phase shift is related to the number of bound states in a potential.</li> <li>The shell model of nuclear structure.</li> <li>The properties of the deuteron.</li> <li>The &alpha;-decay of <sup>238</sup> U.</li> <li>The rotational and vibrational spectrum of diatomic molecules.</li> <li>Dynamical SO(3) &times; SO(3) symmetry of the hydrogen atom.</li> <li>Dynamical SU(n) symmetry of the harmonic oscillator in n-dimensions.</li> <li>Supersymmetric quantum mechanics, beyond what we did in 8.05.</li> <li>The Zeeman effect in weak, intermediate and strong magnetic fields.</li> <li>The Lamb shift in hydrogen - evidence that relativistic quantum mechanics must be replaced by quantum field theory. (This is an example of a topic where you will not be able to give a complete derivation of the effect, but where those of you interested in the history of physics could write a paper which explains the quantum physics more qualitatively while at the same time describing the experiments and the history in full.)</li> <li>The non-relativistic quark model of the proton, neutron and related particles.</li> <li>Isospin - a quantum symmetry of elementary particles.</li> <li>The 21 cm. line of hydrogen and its role in astrophysics.</li> <li>The Casimir effect.</li> <li>Feynman's path integral approach to quantum mechanics, and its application to several problems of your choice which we have previously analyzed using other methods (If you choose a formal topic like this, about a method rather than a phenomenon or problem, you must take it far enough to show how the method is applied to a phenomenon or problem.)</li> <li>The van der Waals force between hydrogen atoms in excited states.</li> <li>Quantum computing? (You may not write a paper that purports to be about &quot;Quantum computing&quot;. You may only choose a topic within this area if you have a focussed idea, perhaps involving presentation of one of the ideas for implementation of a quantum computer, the quantum mechanics of the implementation, the difficulties, etc. Note also that you may not write a paper whose sole purpose is the presentation of Grover's and/or Shor's algorithms, since you will see those in lecture at the end of the semester.)</li> <li>Quantum teleportation.</li> <li>Quantum cryptography.</li> <li>Bose-Einstein condensation.</li> <li>Integer Quantum Hall Effect (There are a number of ways you could go beyond what we do in lecture.)</li> <li>Landauer conductivity in two dimensional systems.</li> <li>Photonic Crystals.</li> <li>Quantum Dots.</li> <li>The deHaas van Alphen effect as a tool for measuring the shapes of fermi surfaces in metals.</li> <li>Periodic potentials and band structure.</li> <li>An introduction to the quantum statistical mechanics of photons and the spectrum of black body radiation. (You could also include an account of how Planck was led to discover quantum mechanics in the first place, or of how the spectrum of black body radiation appears in the cosmic three degree background radiation.)</li> <li>The density matrix formalism in quantum mechanics, and quantum statistical mechanics.</li> <li>Optical pumping, masers, lasers.</li> <li>Masers in astrophysics.</li> <li>Interesting applications of the semiclassical approximation.</li> <li>The Ramsauer-Townsend effect.</li> <li>The Josephson effect.</li> <li>The Wigner-Eckart theorem.</li> <li>Fractional statistics in two dimensions.</li> <li>Squeezed states and applications.</li> <li>Wigner functions and applications.</li> <li>Tunnelling, beyond the discussion in class. The Euclidean approach; effects of nonzero temperature.</li> <li>The microscopic origin and effects of quantum dissipation, for example on tunnelling.</li> <li>Inverse scattering method and its application to solitons.</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"subhead\">5) Writing Tips</h2> <p>Here are some tips that you may find useful.</p> <p>5.1) Structure</p> <ul> <li>Identify a well-defined topic area as early as possible. Changing your focus is fine, but you may find that it requires substantial rewriting to keep things clear.</li> <li>Work through and understand the physics before writing. You should do this over Spring Break. This will ensure that you have a well-defined topic before you start writing. You will find that this will make structuring the paper infinitely easier.</li> <li>Make sure the main points of your paper are clearly indicated. This is especially important for scientific writing, since the reader can easily get bogged down in details. Your main points should be highlighted by the structure of the paper as well as mentioned in the introduction and/or abstract.</li> <li>Write the abstract and, possibly, the introduction last.</li> <li>After you have your outline ready, don't be afraid to draft later sections before earlier sections. If you understand the last half of your argument better than the first, start by writing the last half. Doing so will help you think through how to understand and explain the first half.</li> </ul> <p>5.2) Style</p> <ul> <li>In thinking about both style and structure, remember that you are writing a scientific paper and not a work of literature. The writing in great works of literature typically has multiple meanings, and can be understood in many ways, at different levels. It can be read differently by readers at different times or with different backgrounds. It often makes veiled allusions to other great literature. Over the years, great literature takes on meanings that go beyond those intended consciously by its author. In contrast, the central purpose of a scientific paper is the clear communication of your ideas to your readers, with no ambiguity, multiple meanings or veiled allusions. Your goal is to ensure that every one of your readers, who may indeed have varying backgrounds, understands your ideas in precisely the way that you intend. This means that clarity and precision are your paramount goals. You should seek to ensure that no reader can misunderstand what you intend to communicate in any sentence that you write, even should they willfully try to misunderstand you. To this end, write in simple, declarative sentences, avoid contorted constructions and always aim for clarity.</li> <li>Feel free to use whichever voice you are most comfortable with. &quot;I will show,&quot; &quot;we will show&quot; or &quot;it will be shown&quot; are all fine. For unknown reasons, some students seem to think that personal pronouns are banned and the passive voice is required. Nothing could be further from the truth. Good scientific writing should be animated and compelling. Your paper should &quot;tell a physics story&quot;. I find the overuse of the passive voice to be deadening. Don't be dull. Clarity and precision come first, but don't fall into the trap of thinking that this can only be accomplished via boring your reader to tears. Not true.</li> <li>Try to lead your reader along, motivating their interest, building up the physics ground work you need them to understand, drawing them into the story you are telling, and working up to a compelling conclusion.</li> <li>All the advice I've given you about style is just as important when, later in life, you find yourself preparing a lecture or a seminar.</li> </ul> <p>5.3) Some Details</p> <ul> <li>Be rigorously consistent in your notation, even at the risk of being repetitive.</li> <li>Clearly define every quantity that you introduce.</li> <li>Avoid ambiguous references, such as &quot;this shows&quot;. Instead, use references like &quot;Eq. 4.1 shows.&quot; The LaTeX commands \\label and \\ref are useful here.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">6) More on Peer Editing</h2> <p>As described in the project summary, each of you will act as an editor for one of your peers. (Note: if you cannot find someone to act as your editor, ask Prof. Rajagopal. He will pair people up as he gets such requests. You must list the name of your peer editor as part of your proposal, due on March 29.) When you finish your first draft, give it to your editor for editing. You must give your editor time to complete their work in time for you to submit your peer-edited first draft on Tuesday April 12.</p> <p>As you are editing the work of one of your peers, you should start by praising what the document does well. If the author has made specific requests (i.e. &quot;please see if my argument in this section makes sense to you&quot;) then spend much of your time responding to these specific requests. Do not focus on spelling and the mechanics of writing, unless asked by the author to do so. (Of course, note problems of this sort which you happen to spot, but this is not your main goal and the author should in general not rely on you for this sort of editorial review.) Instead, focus on helping the author to revise content, organization and logic. Do not just criticize. Make suggestions on how to solve the problems you notice in the paper.</p> <p>As you edit the work of your peer, here are some of the questions which you should be thinking about:</p> <ul> <li>What is the paper's main argument?</li> <li>How interesting is it? Is the importance of the topic explained?</li> <li>How specific is the argument? Would it benefit from being made more general or complete? Would it, in contrast, benefit from being made more focussed?</li> <li>Is the paper divided into sections and subsections in a way which makes following its logic easy? Does each section flow logically from the preceding one? Do ideas flow smoothly from one paragraph to the next?</li> <li>Early in the text, is there a clear road map of the entire document?</li> <li>Are all outside sources documented? If, as will be the case for almost all 8.06 papers, the paper contains ideas which are not the results of calculations done by the author and are not ideas we have all seen in lecture, can you see from which source the author learned each such idea?</li> <li>Are all technical terms which are new to you defined clearly, and used consistently?</li> <li>If the paper presents the solution to a problem, what are the arguments on which the solution rests? Do you understand each argument and the solution as a whole? Is each part of each argument substantiated? (Either by calculation presented in the paper, or by reference to 8.05 and 8.06 material which you can see substantiates the argument.) Is there anything missing, which would help complete an argument?</li> <li>If the paper describes a phenomenon, do you understand the description? Is the nature of the phenomenon clearly described? Are the reasons why the phenomenon is of interest clear? Do you understand the quantum mechanical explanation of the phenomenon presented by the author? What do you wish the author had included that would have given you a better understanding of the phenomenon?</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">7) The LaTeX Templates</h2> <p>LaTeX (and its ancestor TeX) are widely used in academic and technical publishing. They are &quot;mark-up&quot; languages, like HTML&reg;, that tell a processor how to construct mathematical expressions that look like typeset text. One of the objectives of this assignment is to give you an experience preparing a physics paper for &quot;publication&quot;. When practicing physicists submit papers to the <em>Physical Review</em>, they do so by emailing a LaTeX file, and perhaps some postscript figures, to the editorial office. If you wish to have your paper published, you will do the same.</p> <p>Many 8.06 students have had previous exposure to LaTeX; some have not. Both to level the playing field and to make possible the publication of your finished papers, we will put a template on the web, for you to download. LaTeX itself is already available as standard MIT Server software.</p> <p>The most computer-illiterate among you - nevertheless more literate than Professors Rajagopal and Liu by far - need only download the templates, open them in your favorite editor (such as <em>emacs</em>), and notice the way the LaTeX template deals with title pages, footnotes, references, equations, mathematical symbols in text and set off from text, equation labels, tabs, and so forth. You can construct your paper by cutting the text out of the template text and inserting your own.</p> <p>In order for students to have access to all necessary macros, already installed on MIT Server, it may first be necessary to type: add newtex. [Note: this was necessary three years ago, but Prof. Rajagopal thinks it is now not necessary.]</p> <p>You should begin by downloading the template, and making sure that you can LaTeX it successfully, to produce output which looks like the hard copy of the template paper which I will post on the server.</p> <p>In order to do this, you will need the commands:</p> <ul> <li>latex filename.tex will run the LaTeX typesetting program to produce typeset output from your input file. If there are errors in your LaTeX file, the file filename.log will contain error messages that are usually helpful. When LaTeX runs successfully, its output is filename.dvi, where dvi means &quot;device independent&quot;. (Note that you will need to run LaTeX twice on the file, in order for all the references to bibliographic items and equation numbers to come out right.)</li> <li>xdvi filename.dvi will display your output in its finished form.</li> <li>dvips filename.dvi will convert the dvi file to a postscript file, send it to the printer, and then delete the postscript file. If, instead, you want to save a postscript file instead of printing it, use dvips -o filename.ps filename.dvi. This creates a postscript file named filename.ps. One reason to do this is that you can then view your output using ghostview (gv) instead of xdvi. gv is a more sophisticated viewer than xdvi. (A final note here: gv by default does not antialias to save time. It can be turned on and off from within gv or you can use the -antialias flag when calling gv to do it automatically.)</li> </ul> <p>The template provided will contain postscript figures. If you know how to produce illustrations in postscript, the template will illustrate how to incorporate them into your paper. If you don't or don't want to bother, you are welcome to draw figures by hand or with your favorite graphics package, and simply staple them onto the end of your paper. Note, however, that if you wish to submit your final paper for publication, you <em>must</em> prepare it using the LaTeX template and <em>must</em> include any figures as encapsulated postscript files, as done in the template.</p> <p>The template uses a macro called BoxedEPS in order to incorporate encapsulated postscript figures. This macro may be available on MIT Server, but to be safe we will make it available for you to download at the same time that you download the template itself.</p> <p>We strongly urge people who are new at LaTeX to communicate with classmates. Likewise we strongly encourage LaTeX wizards to help the less experienced with the nuances of the language.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Sample Papers</h2> <p>8.06 Sample Term Paper (<a href=\"./resolveuid/bf86cc8aad3679c72227f8705ed80bcc\">PDF</a>)</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Supporting Files</h2> <p>BoxedEPS (<a href=\"/courses/physics/8-06-quantum-physics-iii-spring-2005/projects/BoxedEPS.tex\">TEX</a>)</p> <p>Sample Paper (<a href=\"/courses/physics/8-06-quantum-physics-iii-spring-2005/projects/SamplePaper.tex\">TEX</a>)</p> <p>Energy Levels (<a href=\"./resolveuid/b52625fc7e9d7bbcf00628008b2c58f0\">PDF</a>)</p>"}},{"id":"4314f626-a872-54ee-9ae9-b831dd3e8b5d","trackingTitle":"8.06 - Related Resources","title":"Related Resources","url":"/courses/physics/8-06-quantum-physics-iii-spring-2005/related-resources","shortUrl":"related-resources","coursePageType":"CourseSection","text":{"text":"<p>Some Topics have a related experiment in the class <em>8.13-8.14: Experimental Physics I &amp;

In many respects, the full scale and scope of Engineering Systems as a field is still emerging. This seminar is simultaneously designed to codify what we presently know and to give direction for future development. In this spirit, the entire syllabus should be viewed as a living document &ndash; subject to adjustment based on student and faculty input throughout the term.</p> <p>While certain topics, readings and guests change from year to year in this course, the focus across a broad range of topics in Engineering Systems remains the same. Throughout the term, faculty from the ESD program and other parts of MIT will be sitting in &ndash; either as invited guests or just as interested colleagues. We will give priority to comments from students, but also be sure to tap the wisdom of those who are sitting in.</p> <p>Readings will come from a broad range of sources. Nonetheless, we suggest that students have familiarity with <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160313214604/http://esd.mit.edu/resources/symposia.html\">ESD symposia papers</a> generated over the years.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Learning Objectives</h2> <p>The overriding top level objectives are two&ndash;fold:</p> <ol>     <li>Increasing student understanding of research in complex systems so as to allow them to develop a framework for further learning about how to do research.</li>     <li>Fostering a wide understanding of the knowledge content in engineering systems so that the students begin to establish a structure for learning more about the broad front of knowledge that is termed Engineering Systems.</li> </ol> <p>At a more detailed level, the learning objectives are:</p> <ul>     <li><em>Basic Literacy</em>: Understanding of core concepts and principles &ndash; base level of literacy on the various aspects of engineering systems (ES).</li>     <li><em>Inter&ndash;disciplinary Capability</em>: The capability to reach out to adjacent fields in a respectful and knowledgeable way and the ability to engage with other ES scholars in assessing the importance to ES of new findings in related fields.</li>     <li><em>Historical Roots</em>: Understanding of historical/intellectual roots of key concepts and principles in engineering systems.</li>     <li><em>ES and Observations, Data Sources and Data Reduction</em>: An appreciation of the importance of empirical study to cumulative science and its difficulty in complex socio&ndash;technical systems.</li>     <li><em>Critical Analysis</em>: Ability to critically assess research and scholarship aimed at furthering knowledge in engineering systems; development of defendable point of view of important contributing disciplines in the ES field.</li>     <li><em>Links Across Domains and Methods</em>: Ability to identify links/connections across different fundamental domains and methods relevant to ES.</li>     <li><em>Scholarly Skills</em>: 1) The ability to write a professional&ndash;level critical book review; 2) a beginning level ability to develop and write a research proposal in the ES field; 3) the ability to present and lecture on critical analysis of material that one is not previously familiar with; 4) developing wider reading skills and habits.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Class Session Pro&ndash;Forma</h2> <p>The order of the elements is notional.</p> <ul>     <li>Overview (5 minutes), Faculty&mdash;the theme for the week.</li>     <li>Guest presentation and discussion (Occasionally this presentation may be done by course teaching staff) (55 minutes).</li>     <li>Student&ndash;led presentation and discussion of the faculty&ndash;provided readings (30&ndash;45 minutes).</li>     <li>Break (10 minutes).</li>     <li>Teaching Time by course teaching staff (in total, an hour plus or minus):     <ul>         <li>Report from the Front, facilitated by course teaching staff&mdash;popular news article sent out to class on the day before class.</li>         <li>Course teaching staff&ndash;led discussion, and integration of materials.</li>         <li>Next week's class preview.</li>     </ul></li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Note to Doctoral Students</h2> <p>This seminar is designed to help facilitate the transition from being a student taking courses from experts to being a doctoral candidate and then a colleague with your own distinctive voice as a scholar. There are few issues covered in the seminar in which there are simple right and wrong answers &ndash; in most cases it is critical thinking and constructive engagement of the issues that will be most important to your success.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Course deliverables are detailed in the <a href=\"./resolveuid/5ae390ce7feaf9e2fa23ce95300789ee\">Assignments</a> section of this course.</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table summary=\"See table caption for summary.\" class=\"tablewidth75\">     <caption class=\"invisible\">Course grading.</caption>  <!-- BEGIN TABLE HEADER (for MIT OCW Table Template 2.51) -->     <thead>         <tr>             <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th>             <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th>         </tr>     </thead>     <!-- END TABLE HEADER -->     <tbody>         <tr class=\"row\">             <td>Assignment 1: Observations, data sources, and data reduction</td>             <td>10%</td>         </tr>         <tr class=\"alt-row\">             <td>Assignment 5: Book review</td>             <td>10%</td>         </tr>         <tr class=\"row\">             <td>Assignment 6: Historical roots and contemporary methodologies of engineering systems paper and presentation</td>             <td>30%</td>         </tr>         <tr class=\"alt-row\">             <td>Assignment 7: Systems concept assignment</td>             <td>10%</td>         </tr>         <tr class=\"row\">             <td>Assignment 8: Developing a well&ndash;posed research question</td>             <td>10%</td>         </tr>         <tr class=\"alt-row\">             <td>Assignment 9: Critical analysis of an ES research paper</td>             <td>5%</td>         </tr>         <tr class=\"row\">             <td>Assignment 10: Learning summary</td>             <td>5%</td>         </tr>         <tr class=\"alt-row\">             <td>Seminar participation</td>             <td>20%</td>         </tr>     </tbody> </table></div>"}},{"id":"5b9fe059-6f61-55f0-a034-d52348a50569","trackingTitle":"IDS.900 - Calendar","title":"Calendar","url":"/courses/institute-for-data-systems-and-society/ids-900-doctoral-seminar-in-engineering-systems-fall-2011/calendar","shortUrl":"calendar","coursePageType":"CourseSection","text":{"text":"<div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table summary=\"See table caption for summary.\">     <caption class=\"invisible\">Course calendar.</caption>  <!-- BEGIN TABLE HEADER (for MIT OCW Table Template 2.51) -->     <thead>         <tr>             <th scope=\"col\">SES&nbsp;#</th>             <th scope=\"col\">TOPICS</th>             <th scope=\"col\">KEY&nbsp;DATES</th>         </tr>     </thead>     <!-- END TABLE HEADER -->     <tbody>         <tr class=\"row\">             <td>1</td>             <td><p>Present and future &ndash; The incorporation of social science and engineering into research and problem solving</p>             <p>Guest: Joel Moses</p></td>             <td>&nbsp;</td>         </tr>         <tr class=\"alt-row\">             <td>2</td>             <td>How do we know what we know?

Similar to the response to the guest paper, each student (including the discussion leader) is asked to provide a 300 word (or less) comment paragraph that engages the assigned papers. (Note: Only 1 comment paragraph is required per student per week and should cover one or more of the assigned papers). The role of the discussion leader is to lead a thoughtful discussion of the required readings. The focus should be a critical analysis of the readings, and how the readings relate to each other and the larger field of ES. To achieve this, we recommend that the student briefly summarize the key aspects of the readings (in a presentation lasting about 5 minutes), then lead the students through a discussion of 2&ndash;3 carefully constructed discussion questions. The number and scope of discussion questions should be appropriate to guide a 30&ndash;40 minute discussion.
